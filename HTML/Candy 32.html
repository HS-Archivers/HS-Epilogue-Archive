          by the front of his shirt and yanks him down, her hot, furious breath brushing his disgusting face.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

          <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: HoNk. :o)</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">(Vriska) looks into his eyes. She beholds his serene expression and the casual sag of his
          shoulders. His posture is so contemptibly flaccid, it’s as if he’s literally wilting. Her gaze travels to
          where his weird, long fingers are wrapped around the curve of her shoulder. His hand is sticky for some
          reason. She notices a few strands of her black hair clinging to whatever heinous substance is coating his
          hand. It’s an image so viscerally objectionable to her that she nearly vomits. After all she’s been through
          today, this... THIS is the last goddamned straw. Her eyes fill with fury, with indignation, with vivid,
          radiating malevolence, and then it finally happens. </p>
        <p>She just. Plain. Fucking.</p>
        <p>SNAPS.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Don’t you daaaaaaaare</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">(Vriska) clenches her fists together and slams them into Gamzee’s nose. A brutal Double Axe
          Handle right off the hook. His nose makes a crunching sound like someone just stepped on a pile of crackers.
          He stumbles backward, cupping his palms over his face to catch the gush of blood.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): FUCK8NG touch me</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">(Vriska) grabs him under the armpit and delivers a European-style Uppercut with her bloody
          elbow. He expels a wheezy, guttered honk. It comes out slowly, mournfully, like a broken bike horn getting
          backed over by the rear wheel of a hearse. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): EVVVVVVVVER</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She spins out from under his flailing arm and does a full 360-degree pirouette off the
          fucking handle to deliver a ruthless Knife Chop straight to the cartilage at the center of his chest, like a
          veteran butcher getting down to business.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): AG88888888IN!!!!!!!!</p>

          <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: :o(</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Gamzee tries to get his bearings, but (Vriska)’s spinning back in the other direction with
          a Discus Back Elbow. Her elbow connects with his cheekbone hard enough that it shatters. A sharp tooth goes
          flying out of his puckered lips so fast that John has to take flight to avoid it. (Vriska) takes a crow’s hop
          back, grounding herself to swing a lead-legged kick right into his chin. Gamzee goes flying into a nearby
          tree. The first branch splinters under the impact of his spine. He gets clotheslined backward by the second
          one, spins around it and face-plants on a hard root under the tree.</p>
        <p>John winces, but not sympathetically. The impact was just that rough. That HAD to crack a rib or two.</p>
        <p>(Vriska) stalks over to Gamzee and triumphantly lifts him off the ground, high above her head, only to drop
          him and slam her knee into his face again. His lip splits, staining her jeans bright purple. He’s rolling from
          side to side on the ground, groaning as blood bubbles up from his mouth. It sounds like he’s drowning.
          (Vriska) drags him to his feet again, her hands fisted in his shirt. With an impressive maneuver, hard for the
          eye to follow unless you’re a trained wrestler, she adroitly twists a hand in his hair and Reverse Hangmans
          him against the tree branch. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: HONK!!!!</p>

          <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): WHY WON’T YOU JUST</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She slams his throat against the branch again and again. Each time he lets out a sound like
          a damaged squeeze toy, his bloated, slimy tongue unspooling like a frog’s as all the air is crushed out of his
          esophagus. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): D8EEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Shouting like a berserker, (Vriska) perpetrates a textbook Groinal Clawhold around Gamzee’s
          codpiece and rips it right the fuck off. He yowls as if he had actual testicles to be mauled, and for all
          anyone knows, maybe he really does. He paws the air desperately and fecklessly after his treasured purple
          dick-sock, but (Vriska) tosses it over her shoulder and shoves him into the mud with her heel. She grabs
          Gamzee by the hood, pulls him up, and then grinds the top of her shoe along the ridge of his broken nose,
          rubbing her laces into his eyes.</p>
        <p>Ah yes, John pauses his wince to admire, the good old Bootlace Eyerake. Jake loved that one back in the day,
          even though he had much more practice with the receiving end of it.</p>
        <p>Gamzee grabs (Vriska)’s foot by the bridge. Instead of yanking her off-balance, he opens his huge, bloody maw
          of a mouth and... runs his tongue along the rubber bottom of her shoe? (Vriska) freezes. She watches him lap
          the mud—and his own blood—out from between the grooves of the sole. His lips drag lewdly over the ridge of her
          footwear and begin sucking at where her big toe would be, if it were not safely ensconced in several layers of
          rubber and canvas. He draws back, a string of glutinous, tinted saliva connecting the shoe to his lip, and
          catches (Vriska)’s eyes with his own half-lidded gaze. His face is bruised, bloody, swollen. His makeup is a
          nightmarish disaster. But the expression he’s giving her is unmistakable. It’s not fear, not rage, not even
          pain. It’s... </p>
        <p>Lust. </p>
        <p>(Vriska) goes perfectly still, absolutely paralyzed by the sudden recognition. For several seconds, she
          doesn’t dare move a muscle.</p>
        <p>And then, quite suddenly, (Vriska) reaches a plateau of rage so intense, so pure, that she isn’t even seeing
          straight anymore. She howls like a storm cresting over the ocean, drowning out the sound of the human
          government’s tanks firing their first volley over the battlefield. She lunges at Gamzee’s catastrophic face
          lips-first, and practically dives into his mouth, ramming her tongue into his lewd, gaping maw like she’s
          questing for prizes at a carnival. They roll over each other, groping, tearing, tongue-lashing, and vanish
          into the underbrush. </p>
        <p>Gamzee’s unwashed stench is so bad, the motion of him being knocked into the dirt wafts it in John’s
          direction. The stink hits him like an olfactory haymaker, and he does a full 180 to dry heave into the impact
          crater. </p>
        <p>Mercifully, John’s attention is caught by someone calling his name from above. He has never felt so grateful
          for an excuse to look away from anything in his life.</p>
