          the B Plot.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Right about now, Jade should be wrapping up her political presentation to Roxy and Calliope,
          using a lot more graphs and far fewer words than Dave did when roping her into the election. Her approach is
          definitely more heady, but it’s also more accessible. Jade’s got this disarming combo of head-in-the-clouds
          flightiness and the kind of legit, down-to-earth cred that can only be earned by having done something like
          cutting open your own grandfather and stuffing him full of polyurethane foam.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: so you see janes neoliberal austerity measures—</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy groans upon hearing the phrase “neoliberal austerity measures” for no less than
          the third time in this presentation.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: as i outlined here in graph b-2</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: and here in figure a-6</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: and here!!! in this very spooky drawing i dictated to callie</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: (great drawing by the way!!!)</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: ^u^</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: —will no doubt lead to a whole bunch of ugly societal backlashes</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: not just in economic terms but on a number of other more serious vertices that weve been
            lucky enough to avoid on new earth so far</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: u dont say</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: i DO say!!!</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: the thing is that jane is an establishment leader</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: shes looking at doing things the way our old universes did them</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: shes pretty convinced that shes going to be able to replicate the capitalist hierarchies
            that earth had but in a more “responsible” way</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: but none of that stuff actually worked!!!!!</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: and u think karkat can do better?</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: i think its worth it to give him a chance</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: hes a leader of the people AND hes experienced firsthand what happens when establishment
            goes too far</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: which i imagine you can sympathize with!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Jade takes a deep breath, panting a little. Her graphs are floating around the living
          room in disarray. She spins them around her, gliding her hands through the air like a conductor, before
          folding the pages together and shrinking them to pocket size.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: and!!</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: that’s my pitch!!!!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy and Calliope exchange a look. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i’m... </p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: going to get Us tea and snacks. woUld yoU like some, jade?</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: oh</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: yeah sure</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: any preferences?</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: ummm pumpkin matcha if you have it</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: of coUrse. i’ll be right back.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Calliope excuses herself from the conversation, and flees to the kitchen, seemingly
          making no attempt to disguise the fact that she is in fact fleeing. Jade deflates as she watches her go,
          sensing that her presentation wasn’t the slam dunk she was hoping for.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: soooo..........</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: what do you think?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: hmmmm</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: well i gotta say</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: this has been a hella convincing argument all in all</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: buuuuut idk if i can help u out</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: what????</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: why not?!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy presses her lips together, then bounces her palms on her knees. Her gaze slides
          east, right out the window. She and Calliope live in a belfry above New Prospit. One end of their living room
          is an oriel window that looks out over a public park. The other disappears into an arcading hallway lit at the
          far end by a giant stained glass window that Calliope made herself. The corbels supporting it have windy,
          abstract shapes carved into them. This room reminds Jade of her childhood home, except that it’s bright and
          warm and not inhabited in all corners by corpses and ghosts.</p>
        <p class="dirk">That’s why she can’t settle down. That’s what keeps Jade Harley flitting from couch to couch,
          relationship to relationship. She can’t stop thinking to herself that “home” comes awfully close to rhyming
          with “alone.”</p>
        <p class="dirk">Home is John, who doesn’t call anymore. Home is when Rose and Kanaya welcome her in from a cold
          night and help her set lyrics to her sick basslines. Home is here, snorting at Roxy’s irreverent method of
          storytelling and admiring Callie’s art. Home is Dave and Karkat. <em>Especially </em>Dave and Karkat. Jade
          knows that this election is important for a number of reasons, but let’s not mistake her enthusiasm for some
          kind of humanistic altruism. Girl’s got personal reasons for doing all this.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Jade drifts down to sit cross-legged on the couch beside Roxy. She stares at her with a doggish
          expression—eyes wide, head lolling to the side—until she gets an answer.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: i just dont rly</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: care about politics that much i guess</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy turns to face Jade again, smiling apologetically.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: also this election is all kinds of personal </p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: i mean if i came into ur house and asked u to make some grand political w/e against your
            bff</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: would you be all</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh yea totes sign me tf up</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: im alls ABOUT the sowing of discord among my childhood friends</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: siiiigh let me guess</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: dirk got to you first</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: not even</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: i got no problem tellin dirk where to stick it lmao</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: but dirks not the one running</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: you think hes NOT the one pulling the strings behind the scenes?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: sure but give janey a lil credit </p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: shes got more moxie and ambition in her pinky than the rest of us got all together</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: shes been planning this for years</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: but shes yknow</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: ruthless? :B</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy frowns. Jade is being pretty unfair.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: *fragile*</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: shes gotta be miss perfect all the time for the billboards n press meetings</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: always wearin those power suits trying to look like a big bad bitch</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: you mean like....... the condesce?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: wow ouch</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: im not just imagining it though, right???</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: you see it too</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: not to dredge up something horrible from your history</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: but her whole image is just kinda...... *woof*</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: is that what you guys think?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: u and dave and karkat?</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: well... </p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: yeah</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy leans forward and stares Jade down, like she’s searching for something behind
          Jade’s eyes. Jade unwittingly responds in kind, looking for meaning behind Roxy’s gaze. But she comes up
          empty. And to be honest, so do I.</p>
        <p class="dirk">In the spirit of full disclosure, Roxy’s the only one left I haven’t been able to crack. Her
          mind remains a total enigma to me, just like it always has. If I had to guess, it’s her Void powers that make
          her invisible, even to increasingly omniscient parties such as myself. For all intents and purposes, it’s like
          her thoughts don’t exist. She’s the same person, as far as I can tell. She still wears her heart on her
          sleeve. But the bottom line remains: Roxy Lalonde is still utterly fucking inscrutable.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: well janes not perfect</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy shrugs and runs a hand through her hair, which has been recently cut shorter than
          usual.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: and idk if shell be a good president</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: but shes not betty crocker</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: and i luv her and i dont wanna hurt her feelings</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: and thats p much all there is to say on the matter</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Calliope returns from the kitchen with three cups, a handmade teapot, and some candied
          cakes. Jade finally relents.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: fiiiiine </p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: i understand</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: callie what about you?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Calliope sets down the snacks, and brushes Jade’s skirt aside so she can sit down. She
          puts a claw to her mouth and makes a facial expression more complicated than you’d think a skull would be
          capable of.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: oh, i’d rather stay Uninvolved, thank yoU.</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: :(</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i feel like interfering in both politics and a personal argUment between my
            friends woUld be impolite as well as kind of... stressfUl, to be honest.</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: yeah</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: sorry callie i probably shouldnt have put all that on you</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: less apologizing, more snacking!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Calliope claps her hands together. It’s a bright noise. Her tone of voice is bright
          too. All these years and she still can’t believe that she has so many friends. She smiles at Jade, and Jade
          smiles back. The tea tastes great. The cakes are even better. Callie’s an artist in everything she does. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: wow callie youre such an amazing hostess!</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: hehehe roxy youre so lucky to have her</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy giggles. Awkwardly. She gives Jade a gentle jostle, an elbow to the ribs, and
          lowers her voice.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: psst not “her,” “them”</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: oh</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Jade tenses up, and pales. Turns a wide-eyed look to Calliope, who is still smiling
          politely. She realizes, a bit too late, the profoundly insensitive nature of her social misstep. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: oh!!!!!!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">She grabs one of Calliope’s hands.</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: im sorry i didnt mean to be uh... culturally insensitive?</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: oh nooooo! im such an asshole!!!!!</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: yoU are absolUtely not an asshole!</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i didn’t mind being called a girl. i still don’t really mind, it’s jUst not

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: bUt i did take comfort in “being a girl” for a very long time. this is something
            i’ve only recently decided.</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: yea...!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy pauses, even though the lilt of her voice makes the sentence sound unfinished.
          She stutters the next part out.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: m-me too actually</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: you??</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: o yeah we are both a “they” household now</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy? Seriously? </p>
        <p class="dirk">Like I said, fucking <em>inscrutable</em>.</p>
        <p class="dirk">I never would have guessed. Not that I’ve spent much time contemplating issues related to
          gender. I’m pretty secure in my expression of masculinity, and... </p>
        <p class="dirk">You know what? Fuck this. I don’t owe anyone an explanation of any sort on this topic. I’m
          confident with who I am, what I am, my gender, as well as my understanding of the concept. You want my honest
          opinion? It’s fucking fantastic. Good for them. Both of them, I mean, but also, both of them in a singular
          fashion, since each one can now individually be referred to by the conventionally plural word “them.” I’m
          ecstatic for this personal development they’ve embraced, for the people they are, the lack of gender they
          identify with, and the pronouns they prefer. I’ve got no problem with it whatsoever, and frankly, it’s
          <em>fucking insulting</em> anyone would ever imagine otherwise.</p>
        <p class="dirk">So yeah, I’m gonna allow it.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Carry on.</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Jade nods quite thoughtfully. She’d be a doggy’s fucking uncle if she wasn’t gonna
          come across woke as hell about all this. Truthfully though, it <em>was</em> making sense to her. Eye-opening,
          really. Why hadn’t anyone told her this was even an option when she was younger? She probably would have loved

          seeing things beyond her field of vision. A blinding flash of light. A black, perfect circle, burning a hole
          in her eyes. She tries to stand, but her knees wobble and knock together. Roxy shoots out of her seat and
          catches her before she hits the floor.</p>
