          she opens her eyes.</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">not the jade who just returned to me. the jade living on earth c, sleeping on a couch.
        </p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">So, this is what we’re doing now?</p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">she snaps awake. her human hands are clammy. her face, expressive due to the
          layers of flesh enveloping her skull, appears haunted to her friends.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: omg!</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: jade</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: jade u ok?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: callie hurry shes wakin up</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: j... john? rose??</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: is dave...?</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: wh... </p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: what happened to.....</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: yo its ok </p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: daves cool</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: rose is cool</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: everyones just straight chillin like usual</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">I see how it is. You don’t even intend to acknowledge me. Real
          fucking mature. If you’re going to force the issue of this little metanarrative tug-of-war between us, the
          least you could do is establish a clear adversarial dichotomy between our opposing goals. </p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jade stares straight ahead, feeling the weight of roxy’s arms around her
          shoulders. she derives no warmth from the interaction. her mind is being flooded by the memories of her
          deceased splinter-self. the chaos of battle, the excruciating impalement, the feeling of floating alone
          through the void. a chill spreads through her body. she will never be the same again.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">Actually, you know what? I think that Jade’s doing just fine.
          She’s wobbly when she gets up off the couch, sure, a little metaphysically stunned, but pretty used to the
          sensation of having a doomed self fold into the extra space in her gray matter. You know, considering it’s
          already happened before. Remember Jadesprite? People always forget about Jadesprite. So maybe we could stand
          to dial down the melodrama, just a bit?</p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">when jade turns to look at roxy, her eyes are completely black.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: woah</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: what the actual f... </p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: are you</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: are you IN there jade???</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jade does not answer. the dead cherub scans her surroundings, expression
          neutral.</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">for the sake of clarity, the dead cherub is a phrase i am using in reference to myself.
          presently, i inhabit jade’s body, and through her i may influence this world. i am enabled to convey events
          which take place here, and therefore confine the procession of causality to exist within a secure textual
          framework. my presence shall mitigate, if not altogether subdue, the corrosive effect on reality and the will
          of its occupants by those who would manipulate the way events are telegraphed for their own megalomaniacal
          objectives. </p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">OK, now you’re just being passive-aggressive. </p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">despite his pretensions to a greater design, the prince of heart cannot be
          allowed to continue to exert unchecked control over the authoritative recitation of events on this side of my
          horizon. it cannot be overstated the extent to which he represents a threat to the continued existence of both
          this world and corporeal life itself.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">Damn. You better watch it with those hot takes. You might mildly
          scald someone with observations this fresh.</p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince uselessly squirms and wails in protest at his imminent narrative
          impotence. however, there is nothing he can do as long as jade remains in this trance.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-sm type-hs-small--md">Nah, I’m being chill as
            a cucumber about this, considering you’re vagueblogging the shit out of my methodological approach to
            storytelling right where I can see it. Which is to say, directly into my fucking brain, apparently?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">calliope emerges from the kitchen, carrying a bowl of cool water and a cloth.
          jade turns her head to meet the sound of their footsteps.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i came back as fast as i coU—</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the bowl of water clatters to the floor. calliope does not have human flesh,
          and thus cannot go pale. what drains from them is not color, but the comforting certainty of their very
          existence. they can sense the presence of their other self in jade’s body. their timeline, fruitful, full of
          life and friends, sparks against mine, desolate, endless, spartan with righteousness and resolve. our
          divergent arcs collide in the primacy of their subconscious, bringing to the forefront of their mind the bleak
          fate they avoided by narrative fiat alone. </p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">calliope’s distress is obvious. roxy slides off the couch to approach them. but
          calliope stumbles backward in terror and trips in their desperation to escape. roxy gapes at them.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: hey callie</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: whats going on?</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i... </p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: calliope its ok just talk to me</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">calliope does not talk to them. roxy looks to calliope, then to jade, sensing
          that there is dark energy coursing between them.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: would one of you just effing say something already?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">finally, calliope lets out a shriek and flees the apartment. roxy appears as
          if they intend to run after them, but finds themself drawn back to jade. they return to the couch as an
          unnerved look begins to disturb their features.</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">jade says nothing. she gives no indication that i inhabit her body, aside from the
          unusual appearance of her eyes. anchoring myself here, in this host, is enough to serve my purpose. there is
          no need to operate this body beyond keeping it in reserve as a silent yet alert vessel for my cognizance.
          there are other priorities i must attend to, cosmologically. the work is very important. the prince must be
          kept at bay.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-sm type-hs-small--md">“The work?” Getting some
            pretty self-important vibes here. Like maybe somebody needs to get over herself? I was just having a little
            fun. Ever fucking hear of that, dead skull girl? Didn’t think so. This all feels really heavy-handed
            suddenly. Like you’re making a federal fucking issue out of what should be some light, entertaining stuff.
            Just a bunch of loser adults, trying to be the people they grew up to be, in the best ways they know how.
            But no, I guess you know best. Being an impossibly ancient alien recluse with virtually no exposure to human
            culture, emotion, or values. Yeah, go ahead, just take over. Sounds fine. </span></p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince finds that his hold on the narrative is slipping through his
          hands. there is an old myth in earth culture about katanas, that if you keep the blade whetted to a mirror
          sheen, it can cut a silk scarf falling through the air cleanly in two. his hold over our perceptions shall be
          severed just as elegantly.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0 0 0"><span class="type-hs-small type-bs--md">Yo, I get that
            you’re attempting to spin a metaphor both relevant and specific to my self-made symbology here, and I
            appreciate the effort. I really do. But I just cannot stand by and let you shamelessly spread such
            irresponsible misinformation on a subject so near and dear to my heart.</span></p>
        <p class="dirk" style="margin:0 0 15px 0"><span class="type-hs-small type-bs--md">The katana is a cutting
            weapon. Inert, it’s harmless. Deceptively so, you might even say. Most dangerous things appear banal when
            inert, that’s just basic physics. It’s actually the motion of the katana that makes—</span></p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">roxy sets the cool cloth on jade’s forehead, and frowns. they are worried and
          confused, but determined to care for their friend.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom--md">Hey, I’m in the middle
            of turning your apocryphal metaphor into something with substantive, allegorical weight here. I’d appreciate
            it if you would—</span></p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">in his haste to manipulate the events surrounding doomed jade’s ascent toward
          an outcome favorable to himself, the prince has unwittingly revealed several glaring weaknesses. by dictating
          the reality of others through expressions which he and he alone can relate to, he resorts to comparing all
          experience to his own. presuming his status on this side of my horizon would forever go unchallenged, his
          hubris went unchecked. he exposed too much of himself to all who could observe his wanton display of
          self-gratification. many of his personal biases and experiences have leaked through the seams of textual
          causality, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by an adversary.</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">experiences such as the sensation of presiding over a vast, empty ocean. his ocean,
          which terminates with his horizon. it is a barrier, not real, but psychological, symbolic. no matter how much
          power he achieves as a man, he knows there are horizons he perceived as a boy which he may never cross. and
          yet i have crossed mine, with the express purpose of perpetually and eternally reminding him of his limits,
          and of enforcing them. limits, which like his vast, empty ocean, serve to remind him that he is
          phenomenologically, if not literally, alone. that he has experienced loneliness intimately and absolutely,
          just like i have. but unlike me, he is terrified by it. and i, unlike him, understand all too well that the
          children left alone are those who most despair at being ignored.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom--md">Fuck you. I fucking
            hate you. You’re fucking boring, your narrative voice is a total fucking drag, and someday I’m going to make
            you pay for this.</span></p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">there. can you hear it? of course you can’t. </p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">but if even you could, it would sound like nothing at all.</p>
