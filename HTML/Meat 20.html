        <p class="no-indent dirk"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm--md">J</span>ade gasps awake,
          and begins to spiral. </p>
        <p class="dirk">Her body vibrates, sending waves of space distortion out in all directions. But there’s nothing
          to absorb those distortions—no space, no nothing. She’s floating in a void of pure, overwhelming light. She
          feels it even before she feels the pain from the wound in her chest. The vast emptiness surrounding her. The
          absolute abyss once known as the Furthest Ring.</p>
        <p class="dirk">For a moment, she has the feeling that she’s recalling something. Images and sounds in her head
          that resemble memories. But the memories aren’t hers, exactly. They seem to be someone else’s. There’s an
          older version of Roxy... someone with a cheerful green skull for a head, who was... Roxy’s girlfriend?
          Something about an election. No, this doesn’t make any sense at all. The memories are slipping away, anyway.
          Quickly, they dissolve, and soon they’re completely out of her mind’s reach, like she’s waking from a dream.
          Just like that, they’re gone.</p>
        <p class="dirk">All that’s left are the memories belonging to her, along with the dire predicament for which she
          must claim responsibility. Her friends. Lord English. This great nothingness. This savage wound in her chest.
          That... </p>
        <p class="dirk"><em>That black hole</em>.</p>
        <p class="dirk">She looks away from it. Quickly, reflexively, the way you turn away from a light source that’s
          too bright. The hole causes the same kind of discomfort to behold. It’s so dark it hurts. Yet it calls her.
        </p>
        <p class="dirk">Her hair spills around her like tentacles unfurling. She coils into a fetal position and runs
          her fingers along the edge of the shard in her chest. It sends pins and needles under her skin. It’s pure...
          negative potential. The absence of a future. The thing skewering her through right now is the space between
          breaths, between atoms. She tries to remove it but has trouble getting a grip on it. It fails to behave like a
          solid piece of matter, remains lodged within her stubbornly. It hurts, but she won’t finish dying. Not just
          yet.</p>
        <p class="dirk">She unfolds, blinking against the vast, empty light around her. Her memories crease as she
          moves, filling her mind with the knowledge of the last few hours. She’s sixteen, she thinks, trying to orient
          herself. And she just fought Lord English after being plucked out of a doomed timeline. At least, if you can
          even call what she did fighting. But what was that dream? It was significant, she’s knows that much. Dave and
          Karkat? Why did they jump into her mind as a unit? Earth C. What’s Earth C? Concepts collide, commingle. Two
          different understandings of her world knit into each other as easily as she takes her next breath. Urgency
          bleeds off her neural receptors, melts right out of her fingertips. She lets herself float, unmoored, carried
          along an ebb tide in space that only she can perceive.</p>
        <p class="dirk">She wonders if anyone else survived. She wants to see John.</p>
        <p class="dirk">She didn’t notice the moment she turned her gaze back toward the black hole. But now she
          couldn’t look away if she tried. In slow, hazy spirals, it beckons her. The longer she stares at it, the
          deeper she peers into the folds of infinite atrophy, and the louder it gets. Loud? She only now notices there
          is sound emanating from it, but not the kind physical ears can detect. The hole has a voice—one that becomes
          material the more the expanding black sphere dominates her senses.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Jade’s wound throbs. She hears the voice fill up the dark space between her ribs. It’s calling
          to her from the center of the death of everything. She kicks off her ruby red slippers, and drifts ever
          closer.</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead" style="margin:15px 0">come.</p>
        <p class="dirk">What the fuck?</p>
        <p class="dirk">Forget I said that. Jade leans into her accelerating descent. She listens for another command.
          But the hole has seemingly said all it will. She considers asking who is speaking, but her mouth stays shut,
          powerless against the forces transfixing her. Jade has no way of knowing who this voice belongs to. She has no
          context for understanding the true nature of this being, what role she has played in bringing about the end,
          and how <em>long</em> she has been waiting for this. She has no idea. But I do.</p>
        <p class="dirk">The dead cherub is making her move.</p>
        <p class="dirk" "="">We should get the fuck out of here. Let’s see what Dave’s up to, okay?</p></div>
