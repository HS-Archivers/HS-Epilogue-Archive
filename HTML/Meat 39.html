        <p class="no-indent dirk"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm--md">I</span>’m inside Jake’s
          mansion. It’s just as idiotically garish as the last time I saw it. There was once a time I swore I’d never
          set foot in here again, for various reasons I won’t get into. Jake is the type of guy who makes you say stuff
          like that. But he’s also the type who reminds you never to say never. Here I fucking am again, in this useless
          dickhead’s dime-store McMansion. But only because I need one of his ships.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Rose is still asleep from the drugs. I put her on that monstrous, overstuffed velvet couch over
          there. My guy Squarewave is here too. I need his help today, because there’s a lot of cargo to wrangle. He’s
          wheeling something around on a hand truck. Something about the height of Rose, roughly Rose-shaped, and
          wrapped in a cloth. I know she’s gonna love it the first time she sees it. But the only way she’ll be able to
          do that is when she’s awake and looking in a mirror. </p>
        <p class="dirk">Jake owns Skaianet, a company which, among many other things, manufactures spaceships. They do a
          stiff business selling these rigs, especially with all the new military contracts the Crocker administration
          has been handing out. If it weren’t for his connection to a good supply of quality starcraft, I’m honestly not
          sure if I’d even bother stopping by before leaving. I’d have to think about it. Yeah, we’re “friends,” I
          suppose, but there really isn’t much I have to say to this guy anymore. But as long as I’m here, I have to
          confess I’ve been mulling over a few choice remarks to let him chew on while I’m gone.</p>
        <p class="dirk">I didn’t tell him I’d be coming. That would be a scene. He’d “prepare” too much. Roll out the
          red carpet, so to speak. Suggest plans, stammer nervously, throw on something a bit more skin-hugging than
          usual. I may have already mentioned, but I’m a bit too deft at this for my own good. Doing the thing where I
          tug at the part of someone’s latent thought process that already knows they adore me. That if someone would
          just pull the stops from their sense of inhibition, they’d realize they would do anything for me. </p>
        <p class="dirk">Though I could be overselling my methods of persuasion while shortchanging my natural aura of
          charisma and dashing good looks. Maybe I’m just that fucking charming? There are times when I actually do
          manage to underestimate my positive qualities, believe it or not.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Normally, corralling Jake’s attention is like greasing up your whole naked body and tackling a
          shrieking hog on rocket skates. There was always a part of his mind that was conflicted about me—intrigued,
          titillated, wary. But now he’s just plain obsessed. </p>
        <p class="dirk">That wasn’t really what I was going for, but hey. With political warfare comes collateral
          damage. It’s harmless enough anyway. It’s not like I gave him a sick scar, or anything that would hurt his
          value as priceless sexual commodity. The only thing affected was his brain. It’s a bit like if someone hacked
          a comments section. Who gives a shit?</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: DIRK!!!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">I glance up the stairs, where he’s standing on the precipice overlooking the foyer.
          Yeah, he definitely wasn’t expecting company. He’s completely nude, except for a pair of boxers with a pattern
          of green skulls, pistols, and some shapes that maybe are supposed to be pot leaves.</p>
        <p class="dirk">He blunders down the stairs at top speed, runs over and gives me a huge bro-hug, making my spine
          pop. God, he’s so fucking strong. I <em>hate</em> that the brief feeling of being crushed by this oaf makes my
          dick twitch slightly.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hey Jake.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: Uh...</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: I had no idea you had plans to visit my humble abode!</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: To swing about the ole manor du chez ingles as they say.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: I seem to recall the last time we were bumming about the rumpus cabana you swore some
            sort of blood oath youd never set foot in here again with one of your customary dramatic flourishes.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, well.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: I meant it at the time. </p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: Let’s just leave it at that.</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">He’s gently stroking the side of my arm now, making no effort to disguise his interest
          in the contours of my muscles. I use that arm to put a hand on his shoulder in an affable way, so that he’s
          forced to stop.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Hold the phone wasnt she supposed to be off the sauce? Or is that not a thing anymore?
          </p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s not a hangover. She’s just tired.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: Can you help us out?</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Of course mate. Ive got frickin scads of the things lying around.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Prototypes. Top secret experimental models. Galaxy class ball busters dogeared for the
            whiteshirts in the gubmint! ;)</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">He scurries over to a new-money–looking baroque antique cabinet, his ample junk
          swinging about in his loose boxers free as a jaybird. He opens a small door and rifles through a stack of
          stray papers and captchalogue cards.</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">I take it. We’re almost through this dirty little bit of business. I know there’s
          more, though. There always is with him. In fact, here it comes. I can smell it a mile away. I know exactly
          what he’s about to say, and the buoyant obliviousness with which he’ll say it.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: So where are we going?</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, I thought this misunderstanding might happen.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: My bad, man. I wasn’t that clear up front.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: “We” aren’t going anywhere.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s just me and Rose on this trip.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Ooh! I see. </p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Well when you live the married life i suppose from time to time one must get away from
            the old ball and chain one way or another.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: So its a stag night of sorts. In space. With a gay girl instead of a fella! </p>

          cheekbones, the warrior’s eyebrows, the deadly serious yet exquisitely kissable mouth. This is the face he
          lives for now. A visage that, in mere minutes, will vanish from his life forever. The tears drop. His voice

        <p class="no-indent dirk">He explodes into tears. A sloppy, volcanic eruption of mucus, ugly noises, and the
          tatters of a bared soul. </p>
        <p class="dirk">He begins slumping to the ground. But I grab his shoulders roughly and lift him up with a
          violent jerk. I look into his eyes furiously. My glare is incinerating. It halts his infantile wailing like a
          cranky baby somewhere just got tossed into the vacuum of space. He’s scared. No, terrified. Of being left with
          no one who truly cares for him. Of the magnitude of his raw, perilously unearthed feelings. But most of all,
          right here, right now. He’s terrified of ME.</p>
        <p class="dirk">I pull him close with all my strength, flush to my body, wrap my arms around him to cradle the
          back of his head in my calloused palm, and I kiss him. It’s the softest kiss I’ve ever given. My lips yield in
          a way that feels to him impossibly, miraculously forgiving. Like cannonballing into a frozen lake only to
          discover it’s not frozen at all. It’s not even water. It’s a sheet of a thousand layers of silk. It’s a pool
          of a trillion discrete, tiny, shimmering beads of chilled mercury. It’s the final, gentle exhale of the most
          beautiful symphony ever played. It’s the soothing, mythically rumored oasis where the satyrs and nymphs once
          took pleasure and together forged the very concept of comfort we understand today. </p>
        <p class="dirk">It lasts a fleeting moment. Two ticks of the clock over there. Two ticks longer than anyone will
          ever kiss him like that again. Two ticks longer than he ever deserved.</p>
        <p class="dirk">I move my hands up to his face, and with my palms on his wet cheeks, I gently push his head
          about six inches away from my face, and say:</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m sorry, Jake.</p>

          <p class="dirk">DIRK: But I’ll never let you break my heart again.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Abruptly I turn, and walk to the couch. I pick up Rose, nod at Squarewave. He springs
          into action, pushing the hand truck out the door. Without looking back, I follow, and slam the door behind me.
