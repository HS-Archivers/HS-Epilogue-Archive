        <p class="no-indent dirk"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm--md">S</span>peaking of giving
          it everything you got, here comes Jake McGee, about to pop his pistols off in front of a whole crowd of
          Karkat’s progressively prismatic proletarian partisans.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Okay, let’s strike that bit of alliteration from the record. I don’t know what came over me. I
          probably just made the mistake of getting too close to the gaping black hole that radiates pure asininity from
          the space between Jake’s ears. His event horizon of buffoonery has the dual effect of making everything around
          him slightly lamer while sucking unsuspecting victims into wanton sexual indiscretions, which, if you’re very
          lucky, you’ll be too drunk to even remember. But, well, look at him: how can you <em>not</em> fuck this guy? I
          mean, I’m never going to fuck him again, but I bet there’s a good chance that <em>you</em> want to. Don’t even
          try to say you don’t, cause no one’s buying it. After all, that’s what this entire election is about to boil
          down to—decisions made based on the primal fuckability of the dumbest asshole on Earth. </p>
        <p class="dirk">The crowd is all in a tizzy waiting for Jake to sashay his famous ass back up to the podium. It
          was quite melodramatic, that little assassination fakeout I staged. It might have even inadvertently jumped
          the Vantas campaign in the polls. Of course, I’d never do something so stupid as turn Karkat Vantas into a
          martyr. God, could you imagine? The last time some incompetent asshole with his blood color bumbled his way
          into a tragically symbolic death, the entire troll race spent half a millennium stroking themselves off to it
          until they were convinced hearing the word “fuck” could trigger spontaneous enlightenment. No thanks. Jake’s
          going to put an end to Karkat’s political career with the level of gravitas it deserves—all the pomp and
          circumstance of a wet fart.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Here comes the man of the hour. He stops at the base of the stage. Adjusts his bow tie. Rolls
          the hemline on his shorts up another notch to show off the top quarters of his finely tuned and greased vastus
          lateralis muscles. He slides the endorsement speech Dave has so considerately prepared for him out of his
          front pocket. I let him read it over one more time even though there’s nothing in the universe that could
          possibly matter less.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVE: yo </p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: sure you still want to do this</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YEAH. IT’S NOT TOO LATE TO CALL IT OFF.</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BY WHICH I MEAN THIS ENTIRE FUCKING COMEDY OF ERRORS THAT DAVE PREPOSTEROUSLY
            INSISTS ON CALLING A “CAMPAIGN.” </p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OR HOW ABOUT THE ELECTION ITSELF? WE CAN PUT THE KIBOSH ON THAT TOO IF YOU WANT.</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IF YOU’RE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE JAKE, JUST SAY THE WORD. WE’LL STICK A PRONGSHOVEL
            IN THE WHOLE DEAL AND GO HOME.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave elbows him.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OR. YOU KNOW. JUST YOUR SPEECH.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Dont be daffy chaps. If i were the sort of man to balk at a bit of hot potato in the
            evening i wouldnt be where i am today!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave and Karkat exchange a <em>look</em>. They don’t stop him, though, because a plan
          is a plan. Jake spins on his heel and goes swaggering up toward the podium, grinning cheek to cheek at the
          familiar sound of a crowd chanting his name. He sets his speech down and smooths out the paper only to find
          his hands swamped with sweat.</p>
        <p class="dirk">What’s that, Jake? You didn’t notice your hands were sweating until now? Not surprising
          considering how overtaxed your precious few neurons are at any given time.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: I... I... er hallo folks dandy weather were having here isnt it.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Jake’s hands are so sweaty they’ve smeared the words in the speech beyond recognition.
          He begins to panic.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: Er... thank you... everyone for coming out on this benjo of a day to um... </p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Do whatever it is that weve all congregated to do!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">At the bottom of the stage, Karkat and Dave put their heads together in adorably
          platonic conspiratorial kinship. Karkat whispers directly into the shell of Dave’s ear. I don’t even have to
          direct him to do that, it’s just his natural inclination to practically stick his tongue straight to the
          center of Dave’s skull, while practicing a bit of perfectly harmless, nonsexual, intimate close-talking.
          Jesus, if I have to watch one more minute of this beta-bitch calamity I’m going to fucking dissipate on an
          atomic level.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: (WHAT IS HE DOING? I SAW HIM REREAD THE SPEECH.)</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: (yeah)</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: (idk he does this public speaking shit every day maybe this is just how he warms a crowd
            up)</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: (lets give him a... hm)</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: (DAVE?)</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: (ARE YOU OK.)</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: (oh im fine)</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: (for a moment something felt... off?)</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: (AGAIN???)</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: (WHAT, IS THE ASSASSIN GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT AFTER ALL???)</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: (no its not that)</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Its wonderful to see such a jammy cornucopia of supporters!</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: By golly the lot of you sure are enthusiastic about that karkat chap.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Which means that we potentially have a few things in common since ive come here to...
          </p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: To... to... </p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Ive come to... </p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Jake tugs at collar. It feels tight, suddenly. He’s dripping buckets down under his
          suspenders. Dark patches are starting to form on his dress shirt. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: Rather that is to say,</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: In delicate times such as these,</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Even though usually its a toffer of a bad idea to talk politics in public,</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Today we have all most certainly gathered here,</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: T-to have what is definitely a political conversation.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Y-yes that d-does seem to... be the lay of the land.</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Th-that ive come here to... tell you all about my political opinions... </p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Which I will get to um shortly and with er minimal... verbal bricabrac... </p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: B-because I—</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: I...</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">He’s trembling so hard he begins to worry that the crowd can hear it, like the sound
          of somebody shaking a soda can filled with coins. He goes pale as the depravity of what he’s about to do hits
          him like an eighteen-wheeler. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: Ive... made a terrible mistake.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Hey, Jake. Don’t undersell yourself here. You’ve made <em>several</em> terrible
          mistakes, especially as of late. One might even say that you’ve made a <em>shit ton </em>of them, and that’s
          just this fucking week. Or, if you’d prefer, a rusted jalopy stuffed to the whirlygigs with gum feculence, or
          whatever inept combination of archaic word garbage will help underline the sheer level of personal failure
          you’ve managed to achieve.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Why don’t you have a good, long think about that, Jake.</p>
        <p class="dirk"><em>Is this really the time for a good, long think?</em> Jake muses to himself, actually putting
          a finger to his chin like some public domain clip art picture of a befuddled guy. If the crowd is confused by
          his rapid-cycle mood changes, they don’t show it. Jake’s got a bit of a day-drinking problem, which has been
          slavishly documented in the global tabloids. That’s how you avoid responsibility, isn’t it, Jake? You can fool
          your fans, but not yourself. The truth is that there’s a canniness to the act. It’s partially
          <em>cultivated</em>. You’re stupid, but you’re not nearly as stupid as you pretend to be.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: What in the devil was i thinking coming here?</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: Why did I...?</p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: I came here to...</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">... slide the biggest knife any motherfucker ever wielded directly into your friend
          Jane Crocker’s back?</p>
        <p class="dirk">She loves you, Jake, more than anything, and you toyed with her heart. And you would have
          guiltlessly toyed with her “kettle drums” too had it not been for a bit of <em>divine intervention</em>, let’s
          decide to call it. </p>
        <p class="dirk">But wait, you’re thinking. Wasn’t Jane merely executing a cold-blooded maneuver to rein you into
          the stable of her campaign using her body? How are you the bad guy here? </p>
        <p class="dirk">That’s true, she was trying to do that. But come on—she is <em>ever so much</em> less
          experienced than you in these matters, Jake, and without certain invisible guardrails in place to prevent it,
          she would have thrown herself at you again and again with wide-eyed, girlish wonder.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Or at least, that’s what you like to believe. That people can’t resist you. That you have no
          responsibility for their feelings. That everyone uses <em>you</em>. That<em> you’re</em> the victim. Yes, it’s
          <em>so unfair </em>that anyone in this universe or the last has ever had a single expectation of Jake English.
          Why should anyone respect your personal autonomy when you’re practically begging to be taken advantage of?</p>
        <p class="dirk">So tell me, Jake: which one of us is <em>really</em> the bad guy here?</p>
        <p class="dirk">Jake begins to tear up. He wipes his eyes with what he thinks is a subtle and manful feint, but
          everyone in the crowd sees what’s up. He’s trembling, feeling small and naked and raw, like new flesh after a
          scab’s been pulled away.</p>
        <p class="dirk">He’s scared. He’s <em>been</em> scared. He’s been running from this feeling his entire life, all
          because he was so pants-shittingly terrified of being in love with Dirk Strider. And why wouldn’t he be
          afraid? He knows what will happen when he finally admits it. Knows deep down that to truly love Dirk would be
          to submit to him. That’s a scary thought. It takes a certain degree of mental fortitude to admit that you love
          someone so intensely it could subsume your entire personality.</p>
        <p class="dirk">But Jake can see now that it’s simply how things were meant to be. There are leaders in this
          world, and there are followers, which is a fact that has absolutely nothing to do with the position one
          prefers in the bedroom. Jake can’t believe he’s wasted years denying something so elemental to his nature that
          it might as well be on the periodic fucking table.</p>
        <p class="dirk">He braces his shaking hands on the podium and tries to catch his breath. His mouth is filling
          with saliva, much like it does when he’s about to throw up. Or when he’s desperately, devastatingly aroused.
          Jake, are you <em>aroused </em>in public, thinking about your ex? And in such tight shorts.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Sorry, I’m overdoing it. That should be enough. Dude’s about to pop off. The words erupt from
          his mouth like a tragic, Dirkthirsty Vesuvius: </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jake">JAKE: <em>I love dirk!</em></p>

          <p class="jake">JAKE: <em>IM IN *LOVE* WITH DIRK!!!</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">And to love Dirk is to obey him.</p>
        <p class="dirk">What would Dirk want him to do in this situation? Definitely not sell out his good and dear
          friend Jane for a loudmouthed pipsqueak who noisily transcends failure even as he redefines it. Do good by
          her, Jake. Do good by <em>me</em>.</p>

          outstretched to stop Jake from doing what he thinks he’s doing. He’s fast, but not fast enough.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Jake opens his big, dumb mouth to make the only important contribution to the plot he ever has
