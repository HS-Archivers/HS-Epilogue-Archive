        <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm--md">J</span>ohn’s been spending a
          lot of time with Roxy lately. Which also means spending a lot of time with Calliope, which is awkward, but
          fine. But it also means spending a lot of time with Gamzee, which is awkward, and not even remotely fine.</p>
        <p>John, Roxy, and Calliope are taking a stroll through downtown New Prospit. Gamzee’s here too, a couple feet
          behind John, doing essentially the same thing that the other three are doing. Which is walking at a leisurely
          pace, but he’s being so weird about it that you can’t really call it strolling. It’s more like he’s... holding
          court, while somehow remaining in motion. Ever since he popped out of that fridge smelling like a sweaty foot,
          he’s been all “wise” and “sage-like.” John considers that if he were using these two descriptors out loud,
          he’d make air quotes while saying them. He’d then say Gamzee’s acting almost like a “priest,” which is a word
          he would also make air-quotes around, due to how insanely full of shit John still believes him to be.</p>
        <p>Roxy and Calliope, however, apparently do not believe him to be full of shit, for some reason. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: isn’t that nice?</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: huh?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Gamzee is leading a line of adoring carapacians trailing behind him, telling them stupid,
          fake-zen stuff like “YoU GoTtA sToP tO sMeLl ThE sEeD fRoNdS mY dUdEs.” Not to be speciesist or anything, but
          the sight is kind of worrying because John knows all too well how susceptible carapacians are to grassroots
          populism. He has it on good authority that virtually any schmuck can blunder into a crowd of them, say a few
          inspirational words, and incite revolutionary fervor amongst the masses. John tries his best to ignore it and
          walk ahead, but Roxy loops her arm through his and pulls him back.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: were here check it</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: where’s here?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: me n callies fave cafe!!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">It’s a nice place. Big, oval windows, flowers on all the tables. It’s got a French-ish
          aesthetic. John says “ish” because everything on Earth C is sort of “ish.” “Alternian-ish,” “Derse-ish,”
          “Japanese-ish.” He’d even describe the sky as being kind of “blue-ish.” Sometimes, it’s more turquoise than
          anything. Too crisp and bright, like the old Earth’s sky as seen through a pair of tinted novelty glasses.</p>
        <p>John doesn’t mean to be cynical about it, but he guesses that’s just the mood he’s in. Maybe it has something
          to do with the fact that Calliope insisted on including an unbelievably smelly clown on an otherwise perfectly
          pleasant stroll.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="john">JOHN: that’s it? we’re going to a coffee shop?</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: i got out of bed for THIS?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: lmao</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh john ur so FUNNY</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: no seriously roxy i just... </p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, i feel like i haven’t left my house in years, and with all the stuff that’s been
            going on, like rose’s illness, or that stuff about the “political situation,” is it really a good idea for
            us to be having picnics and going out to coffee shops?</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: oh john, don’t worry so mUch aboUt things that yoU have no control over.</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: like i said the other day, it’s time for Us to leave Ugly things behind Us.</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: yea for real john cant u just enjoy what a beautiful day it is</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: i know IM enjoyin it</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: since i get to spend it with u like ive always been wanting</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: you... you have?</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: yeah duh</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She tugs him against her side and rests her head on his shoulder. She’s a bit taller than
          him in her nice shoes, so it’s kind of awkward. Feels uncomfortable to him, and looks more so for her. But
          he’s enjoying the attention. Sort of. He missed her, the way she used to be, when the two of them were close
          as kids. She’s laying it on a little thick for his benefit right now, and while he can appreciate that, it can
          be difficult to rekindle a friendship after it’s gone cold for a while. John wishes the rekindling period
          would hurry up and end already so they can just go back to shooting the shit like normal.</p>
        <p>Roxy drags him into the cafe. Calliope doesn’t follow them in, for reasons he can only guess at. He catches a
          glimpse of her through the window: a little forlorn, Gamzee at her side like a faithful dog. He can’t hear
          what they’re saying.</p>
        <p>Outside, Calliope clasps her hands and directs a wistful expression through the cafe window, foot traffic
          splitting lazily around her and Gamzee as they stand in the busy street. At high noon, her little body casts
          almost no shadow on the cobblestone road.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: sigh.</p>

          <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: WhAt’S sHaKiN sIs, YoU lOoK bUmMeD aLl ThE fUcK oUt.</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: can’t yoU see what’s happening with roxy and john?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Gamzee stares through the window. Roxy is leaning across the table to dab at the corner of
          John’s mouth with a napkin. John looks very confused, because they aren’t actually eating anything yet. Gamzee
          stares at this for a very long time, his mouth lolling open as he contemplates what is transpiring with the
          closest facsimile to wisdom he can muster. He puts one of his huge hands on Calliope’s narrow shoulder, all
          comforting-like.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: Oh YeAh. FoR sUrE yOuR gIrL rOxY iS aLl GlObEs DeEp iN tHaT dUdE’s DaNk NoOk.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Gamzee leans in so that his face is level with Calliope’s. His grin shows every single one
          of his teeth. Miraculously, his breath smells worse than his body.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: MOTHERFUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? &gt;:o)</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: no!</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: gamzee, no, please! it’s fine.</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i might be sad, bUt john has made his choice, and we mUst all live with the
            repercUssions of that.</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i’m sUre that roxy will be very happy with him.</p>

          <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: we’re all going to be very, very happy. I trUly believe that. ^u^</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Calliope walks away, looking somewhat less than very, very happy. Gamzee remains standing
          in front of the cafe, still not entirely convinced that he shouldn’t motherfucking do something about it.</p>
        <p>John notices him there, just outside the window, leering at him and Roxy. His expression is serene, vacant.
          Calliope is nowhere to be seen.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="john">JOHN: um, hey roxy... </p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: wats up</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: gamzee. he’s staring at us, and it’s kind of creeping me out.</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh</p>

        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Roxy takes a sip of her tea. Her purple lipstick leaves a stain on the fine china.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="roxy">ROXY: yeah john its totes sad</p>

          <p class="roxy">ROXY: wat a tragic misunderstood figure :’(</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Roxy sighs and spears the cherry atop her cheesecake with the absurdly tiny dessert fork it
          was served with. She pops it in her mouth with a pouty little lip pop, staring directly at John with her eyes
          half-lidded. He thinks she might be trying to be sexy, but he’s a bit distracted by the sight of Gamzee
          lumbering into the cafe with all the grace of an aubergine sasquatch sporting an epic erection. He puts both
          hands on the back of Roxy’s chair and looms over her. Without breaking eye contact with John, Roxy scoops up a
          spoonful of cheesecake and feeds it to him.</p>

        <p class="no-indent">John attempts to furtively gesture his disapproval with the entire situation toward Roxy by
          vaguely swiping his neck in a horizontal direction with his fingers, but she doesn’t notice. Instead she puts
          her fork down, slides her chair out, and springs to her feet with an abundance of this newfound enthusiasm
          he’s been struggling to understand.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

        <p class="no-indent">John and the date’s repulsive third wheel watch as she scurries to the back of the
          establishment. The moment the door to the bathroom closes, Gamzee lumbers into a sitting position across the
          table from John, without the slightest deviation in his heinously awkward comportment. He puts his forearms on
          the table in front of him, folds his hands, and gazes into John’s eyes with what he has come to identify as
          Gamzee’s signature brand of faux serenity.</p>
