          open to the sound of a heart monitor and the sight of a featureless white ceiling. Fluorescent lights,
          diaphanous curtains, everything crisp and clean. </p>
        <p>A hospital? </p>
        <p>Wait, this doesn’t seem right, she thinks. When she closed her eyes, she was dramatically lingering about her
          bedroom at home. She’d just taken a handful of pills, and said goodbye to... </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="rose">ROSE: John!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She shoots up in bed, tugging the IV taped under her elbow. Kanaya is sitting at her
          bedside, hemming a sundress. She thins her lips and gives Rose a half-lidded look.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: “John”</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Is There Something I Should Know</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">This is the sort of joke that would have gone over better if it had not been made at this
          exact moment. With all the distance between them lately, Kanaya’s jab lands like a rock plunging into a
          stagnant pond.</p>
        <p>Instinctively, Rose raises her hand to her forehead, but there’s no pain there. Her head is the clearest it’s
          been in months.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="rose">ROSE: Kanaya, what... </p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: What happened?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Kanaya throws her sewing project aside and sweeps in close, wrapping a cool palm around
          Rose’s arm. Her voice quakes but retains most of its porcelain decorum.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Came Home And Found You Passed Out In Front Of The Load Gaper</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: The Doctor Said That Your Heart Rate Dropped Below Thirty Beats Per Minute</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Which As I Understand It Is Somewhat Dire</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: How Are You Feeling</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Rose considers this for a very long time, eyes fixed on the window at the other end of the
          room. The night is dying behind the thin, pale curtain. She can barely see the moon.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="rose">ROSE: I feel... </p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She looks back to Kanaya, eyes wide and bright.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="rose">ROSE: Kanaya, I feel... fine.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">It’s been such a long time since she’s felt anywhere in the same ballpark as “fine” that
          it’s almost an out-of-body experience to say the word. She feels giddy.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: No Headaches</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: No headaches, no visions. Nothing at all. I... </p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Wait.</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Is John ok?</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Where is he? Did he leave?</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Leave</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Oh No Johns Fine</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: He Didnt Go Anywhere</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Except I Suppose To Leave His House For Once</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Multiple Days In A Row Even</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Rose shuts her eyes and takes a deep breath. For some reason, she’s never felt so relieved
          in her life. She thinks about what she was about to send John off to do, and her feelings of grim urgency
          surrounding the matter. And yet, for the life of her, she can’t bring herself to care about whatever it was
          she felt was so direly important about his decision. All that matters to her now is that he’s safe, in good
          health, and spending time with those he cares about. And apparently, due to a perfectly inexplicable turn of
          events, so is she.</p>
        <p>The door to the room creaks open, and in slips a smiling carapacian in blue scrubs. Rose listens to Kanaya
          ask fretful questions about her condition. The nurse responds by tapping her clipboard in a musical rhythm.
        </p>
        <p>Rose opens her eyes. She stares at the knob of her wrist and frowns. She’s not sure why this sensation should
          be concerning. It’s not like her memory is slipping away. She remembers the conversation she had with John
          this morning quite clearly. As she does the previous years of declining health, and troubled, obsessive
          thoughts about canon, dissipation, and other such abstractions. What’s slipping away instead is the feeling
          that any of it mattered at all. Was she insane to be so consumed by such lofty concerns, and is she only
          beginning to experience clarity today, for the first time in ages? </p>
        <p>When the nurse leaves, Kanaya puts a hand over the wrist that she is so preoccupied with.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Is Something Wrong</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: It just seems like all of this is happening so quickly.</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Even... abruptly.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Oh Im Sorry Would You Prefer For Your Consciousness To Continue To Disintegrate</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Don’t be ridiculous, Kanaya.</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: What I would prefer...</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: ...is to be here, with you.</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: <em>Really</em> here with you.</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: For the first time in a long time.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Kanaya tips her face away from the light to hide it in the curve of her shoulder. Rose
          reaches out and takes her wife’s hands in her own. They’re colder than she remembers.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="rose">ROSE: Are you crying?</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Since When Have I Been Known To Cry</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Quite often, actually. But usually because you’re angry.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well </p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Im Not Angry</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: It was hard on you, wasn’t it?</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: My illness? Combined with all your duties to the Mother Grub, the pressures of the
            changing political situation...</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: With all that on your mind, it can’t have been pleasant to have to come home and take
            care of me as well.</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: I can see now that it was all terribly unfair to you.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: It Was Nobodys Fault Rose So Please Dont Take Any Undue Responsibility Onto Your
            Shoulders</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Since when have I been known to do such a thing?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Kanaya’s lips twitch into a smile and she laughs, sadly. Her laughter forces the tears out.
          They drip down her perfectly made-up face in thick trails.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Really Did Think I Had Lost You</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Its Not That I Thought You Would Die</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: It Was That You Felt So Far Away</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: What You Were Going Through Was Something That I Could Not Possibly Understand No
            Matter How Patient I Was Or How Deeply I Loved You</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: There Was A Feeling I Couldnt Shake That Something Terrible Was Going To Happen To
            Us</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Something That Neither Of Us Could Stop</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: A Powerful Outside Force That Would Take You Away From Me</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: And I Couldnt Stop Myself From Thinking That Maybe</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Maybe That It Would Be For The Best</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: Kanaya...</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Can Now See That This Is Completely Ridiculous</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Kanaya laughs again. Gaily this time, as if some terrible, dark weight has been lifted from
          her shoulders. She lets out a thin, shaky breath afterward. It’s like the noise fills the room back up with
          oxygen. Rose hadn’t realized that she’d held her breath at all; the shadow hanging over Kanaya’s thoughts was
          hanging over hers as well. But now that she’s said it aloud, the darkness dissipates without ever
          materializing into its true shape. </p>
        <p>Rose uses the hem of her hospital gown to wipe the tears off Kanaya’s face.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="rose">ROSE: It really is. Honestly, Kanaya, I’ve never heard such a ridiculous thing in my life.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: You Are Talking To Me As If I Am A Pupa Again</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m sorry.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: No Do Not Apologize It Has Been A Very Long Time Since Youve Had The Energy To Use
            Such A Condescending Tone Of Voice</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: And As You Know Its One Of The Things About You I Find Most Adorable</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: I can imagine how adorable I’ve been, drifting around the house like a sweaty,
            drugged-up ghost.</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: While You Know How I Feel About The Careless Imbibing Of Human Intoxicants</p>

          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Not To Be Trite But There Is Nothing That Could Make You Not Beautiful To Me</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: What a relief, considering that we are both going to be young and magically fit
            literally forever.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Kanaya presses a snotty, uncharacteristically imperfect kiss to the back of Rose’s hand,
          right beneath where she wears her wedding ring.</p>

          <p class="rose">ROSE: There’s no one who understands me like you, Kanaya. No one who looks at me the way you
            do. No one who brings me back down to earth with ceaseless, brutal honestly like you.</p>
