  <p>She keeps close watch on the political landscape. She’s got people with eyes on every newspaper and website on Earth C, but she likes to watch the human news herself. It’s just such a delightfully adult thing to do, she thinks, as she spreads out languorously in front of her television. She remembers her father doing the same all the time. Well, without the luxurious silk robe and eighty-inch TV screen.</p>

  <p class="jane">JANE: You know what, I’m surprised to say that this administration isn’t too shabby after all.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: I was really worried that one of the candidates would naively roll back the troll population control ordinances once Kanaya got the Mother Grub up and running, but they’re taking a really hard line on this. </p>

  <p class="no-indent">Gamzee, as ever, stands by Jane’s side, assisting her as she jots down notes about the political events of the day. When she asks for a fresh pen, he fishes one out of his codpiece and hands it to her, but he looks uncharacteristically disquieted.</p>

  <p class="jane">JANE: Or carapacian, or what have you.</p>

  <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: YeAh I dOn’T fOlLoW, hOnK.</p>

  <p class="jane">JANE: What if we lived in a world where there were only one size of shoe?</p>

  <p class="jane">JANE: No, Gamzee!</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Everyone needs shoes that fit the size of their feet!</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: You need to make unequally sized shoes for unequally sized feet!</p>
  
  <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: Oh WoRd? I aIn’T kNoW aBoUt AlL tHaT bOo BoO bUt If YoU sAy It’S tRuE.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Sigh. Yes, it’s true.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: It’s the same with building laws that are conducive to a functioning, equitable society.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Some people are simply born into positions that confer upon them certain advantages, and it is the job of the government to ensure that people who are less fortunate can be “lifted up,” as it were, to match their luckier peers.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: We must offer greater assistance to some classes of people than others, to ensure that equity.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Such is the case with natural troll and human birth rates.</p>
  
  <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: sO yOu SaYiN yOu NeEd DiFfErEnT sHoEs FoR yOuR hUmAn DiCkS aNd WhAt NoT?</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Precisely.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: The reintroduction of the Mother Grub changes everything.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Trolls and humans don’t have identical birth rates. It’s a fundamental biological fact that natural troll reproduction is much faster than humans’.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: It’s a matter of evolution and society!</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: You know this, Gamzee. Your people evolved in a harsh, unforgiving world, where the slightest misstep could lead to death.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: And like any animal would, your biology adapted to the circumstances.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Your Mother Grubs have the capacity to produce an unimaginable quantity of eggs at a time, to ensure that at least a few can survive to reproductive age.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: And I understand that in the context of Alternian society, that worked great. Because the mortality rate was so high, only a manageable number of individuals were able to make it to adulthood.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: But we have a peaceful society now, with benevolent caretakers and fair laws. No young troll is at danger of being killed by monstrous fauna. No one will be culled for being “too weak.”</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: But that doesn’t change your biology.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: So what does that mean for the troll population? It would spiral out of control within a matter of generations!</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: You would come to outnumber humans at a factor of thousands, millions to one. </p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: The infrastructure would not be able to keep pace. The economy would be completely destabilized. The market would be flooded with thousands of trolls who wouldn’t be able to find jobs or places to live.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Not to mention the issue of your life spans. Some of you will live for hundreds, thousands of years!</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: And, honestly... speaking of biology... </p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: I’m not sure, if we were to loosen population controls right now, that your people have... how to say... </p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Well, let’s just say I think it would be irresponsible to gamble on whether or not the natural Alternian order will reassert itself in such a troll-dominated society.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Maybe in a hundred, two hundred years, when you’ve proven—and I believe you will, I really do—but when you’ve proven that you can coexist in a harmonious society with natural breeding, it might not matter so much exactly how many more trolls there are than humans.</p>

</div>
  <p class="no-indent">Jane narrows her eyes at the disingenuous buffoon. This is not the first time she has had a conversation like this with him by any stretch of the imagination. Not even someone as willfully loathsome as Makara could be this dense. What’s more likely is he’s attempting to get a rise from her. To get her a little hotter under the collar. To put her in a certain mood.</p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">  
  <p class="jane">JANE: I just explained: it’s essential that these regulations remain in place so that the human and troll populations can remain proportionate.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: It isn’t as if this is an issue comparable to racism within a single species, a phenomenon
rooted solely in spurious cultural stereotypes, junk science and knee-jerk bigotry.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: There are objectively real and quantifiable biological and behavioral differences between
our species, which absolutely must be accounted for if we are to live in a harmonious society
together, where no species holds any advantage over another.</p>

  <p class="jane">JANE: UGH!</p>
</div>
  <p class="no-indent">In spite of Jane’s protests, Gamzee makes a desperate play for a lusty squeeze. Jane puts up a valiant show of resistance, but Gamzee knows she has no real intent of fighting him off—it’s all part of the kismetic dance. He has his big clown mitts right on her busty bags, honking away. </p>
  <p>As soon as Jane starts screaming, the baby does too. Jake, sitting approximately six feet away, bounces the infant a little to calm him down.</p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">  
  <p class="jake">JAKE: I say would you mind keeping it down for tavros?</p>
  
  <p class="jake">JAKE: He was sleeping and to be honest i think things here are getting a little blue for a baby.</p>
</div>
  <p class="no-indent">Jane and Gamzee break apart at once. It’s like she’d forgotten that Jake was there at all—she scrambles to cover herself properly the moment his voice cuts through the din of sloppy, moist honking. </p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Jake! Darling.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Don’t worry. Th-there’s plenty of attention to go around, my love.</p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Would you care to join us?</p>
  
  <p class="jake">JAKE: Erm its ok i think its time for tavros to be fed anyway. Why dont i just take a bottle and get him out of here so you two can... </p>
  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, yes, yes. Gamzee, get him a bottle, won’t you?</p>
</div>
  <p class="no-indent">Jake, who had been sitting on the other side of the couch with sweet baby Tavros in his arms, remains stiff with his squalling infant as he waits for Gamzee to carry out his commanded task. The clown bends over revoltingly in front of the couch, full rump straining against his plush purple briefs, as if daring Jake to look away—and he can’t. Jake stares transfixed into the full moon of the clown’s buttocks, appearing virtually shrink-wrapped by the moist fabric, as Gamzee slowly descends, fingers trailing down the entire length of his leg. His codpiece bobs between his spread thighs as he grasps the bottle of milk that had been knocked to the ground in the fracas. Then he snaps right back up with a honk that nearly makes Jake rocket out of his seat. </p>
  <p>Jake’s heart is racing so hard he loses focus. He doesn’t notice that Gamzee is offering him the bottle until Jane’s angry voice wrenches him back to his senses.</p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">  
  <p class="jane">JANE: Gamzee! That’s been on the ground! Get him a clean one.</p>
</div>
  <p class="no-indent">Gamzee shrugs, and squirrels away the half-spilled bottle in his codpiece. He walks off and returns with a fresh bottle from the fridge, then hands it over to Jake. </p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">  
  <p class="jake">JAKE: Haha thanks ill just be going now. See ya. </p>
</div>
  <p class="no-indent">Jake snatches the bottle from Gamzee’s hand and all but flees the room in as brisk a walk as he can manage. Baby Tavros calms down as soon as the rubber nipple is in his mouth. </p>
  <p>But no matter how far Jake walks down the long corridors of Jane’s mansion, the lascivious honks echo through the halls like the wails of a dolorous ghost. Nowhere is truly safe. Every little noise emanating from that cursed living room shoots through Jake’s skull like a gunshot.</p>
  <p>As Jake gently bounces the baby in one arm, he takes out his phone to text an old friend.</p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">  
  <p class="jake">JAKE: Jade are you there?</p>
  
  <p class="jade">JADE: yep!</p>
  
  <p class="jade">JADE: whats up?</p>
  
  <p class="jake">JAKE: Can we call?</p>
  
  <p class="jade">JADE: sure jake!</p>
</div>
  <p class="no-indent">Jade has started up a voice call before Jake can even move to do it himself. It’s such a relief to hear her voice. It’s something to focus on besides the—</p>
  <p>OHHHH! HONK!</p>
  <p>Jake winces. </p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">  
  <p class="jade">JADE: jake!!! its been a while since you called!</p>

  <p>HOO HOO HOO, THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT TO THE DARK CARNIVAL!!!</p>
  <p>honk HONK honk HONK.</p>
  <p>The sound of his wife’s rapturous howling unmoors the last of Jake’s composure. He staggers, threatening to spill soft little Tavros on his soft little head, killing him forever. It’s not safe to stand. So Jake shuts himself into the first empty room he comes across and lets himself slide to the ground against the closed door.</p>
<div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
