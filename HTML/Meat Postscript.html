          horizon...</p>
        <p>The distant sounds of war travel above the canopy of a forest. The artillery fire fades to a series of muted
          knocks and thuds as the sound waves cross beyond a thinning patch of the forest and arrive in a clearing of
          grass and shrubbery. Above, the sky is dramatic, colorful, menacing. The way it looks when a storm is coming.
          The clouds are wild, whipped into a sort of spatial frenzy, as if they know what’s imminent is no earthly
          phenomena. Aradia stands in the field, her mouth gaping wide. But not at the sky. </p>
        <p>It’s unusual she isn’t grinning, and she slowly corrects this. She smiles brightly at the girl crouching on
          the ground ten paces before her. Aradia’s never seen anything like what she just saw this girl do. </p>
        <p>Jade was sixteen years old when she showed up, and she doesn’t look a day older now, though many hundreds of
          days have passed. There’s a hole piercing the Space symbol on her shirt, but no sign of whatever it was that
          made it. Her legs are covered by the same striped tights as usual, but her feet are shoeless. Her knees are
          pressed into the mud of the field, and her hands braced against the ground to support her hunched figure. She
          is covered in blood almost from head to toe.</p>
        <p>Fresh blood and viscera surround her in an uneven ring on the field. It soaks her clothes, coats her skin,
          still gleaming and wet, running slowly down her limbs and face, dripping from her mouth, glasses, and the tip
          of her nose. Her hair is matted, savage-looking, filthy. She looks up. Behind the rim of her glasses, her wide
          eyes are solid black. Her lips are parted, revealing her canine fangs. The meat she’s chewing is stubborn,
          raw, full of gristle. Almost supernaturally tough. But she is a determined beast of prey. She swallows once,
          hard. The last bit of her meal slides down her throat. The deed is finished.</p>
        <p>She stands up and closes her eyes. An aura of darkness gathers around her. The blood begins to dissolve, as
          if being absorbed into her skin. She makes two fists, plants her feet firmly, and releases an otherworldly
          howl. A shock wave emanates from her body, knocking Aradia down. It rushes outward, blowing the surrounding
          trees back as if they’re weathering hurricane-force winds. In a moment, calm is restored. She opens her
          perfectly black eyes again.</p>
        <p>Aradia staggers back to her feet and brushes herself off.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i take it everything went as you hoped</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade looks down at her hands as if they belong to an alien. She can feel it now. Abilities
          have been awakened inside her that no being has ever commanded before. She raises her hands and looks up at
          the sky. Above her, an immense vortex opens. It swirls many miles upward into blackness, and lightning
          crackles within.</p>
        <p>Jade does nothing for a while. She seems to simply study the construct she’s summoned, this great occult
          trumpet beckoning her into its abyss. Her face is expressionless. Her glasses flash white as they reflect the
          lightning that arcs sporadically inside the wormhole.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: well?</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: arent you going in</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: wasnt that the idea or did i not... </p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade silently holds up a hand, as if telling her to wait. Aradia closes her mouth, looking
          embarrassed.</p>
        <p>Nearby, a red haze gathers in the air. It condenses into concentric rings and spheres of ruby light. The
          luminous shape of a man fades into the center of the special effect. When the light subsides, Aradia notices
          the man is made of polished metal. She recognizes the gear symbol on his chest, identical to her own. She also
          recognizes the sunglasses the robot is wearing. She knows who this is.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: dave?</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: sup</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">He doesn’t look in Aradia’s direction. His eyes, glowing bright enough to be visible behind
          his shades, are fixed on Jade. He looks her up and down. She’s still so young. He knew this Jade many years
          ago, but by this point their paths have diverged in ways that he couldn’t begin to describe even if he wanted
          to.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: so we doin this</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade says nothing, and looks up into the wormhole again. She begins to levitate, gradually
          picking up speed. Without looking back, she rockets into the vortex, vanishing into the darkness. Davebot
          turns to Aradia.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: how about you</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: wanna come along</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i guess so?</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: im really not sure whats going on here</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: to be honest the plan wasnt discussed much</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: thats what were doing now</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: discussin the plan</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: what about your boy</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: eyepatches</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: oh sollux is in one of his moods</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: this was all getting to be a bit much for him</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: if i go ill probably just cut him loose</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: good move</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">His gaze remains fixed on her. She blinks and looks away, unsure what to say next. He’s
          standing perfectly still, presumably waiting for her to say something. She met him... what was it? Once, twice
          before? She can’t remember. But she knows this is a very different Dave. Aside from the metal skin, he seems
          implacably confident. But then, people go through changes. She’s been through more than her share. She cocks
          an eyebrow, recalling her own stint with a metal body. </p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: hey earth to whats your face</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: oh</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: its aradia</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: i know</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: um...</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: so thats a yes then</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: what</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: youre coming</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: better decide quick i doubt that dank fuckin hell funnel is staying open for much
            longer</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: yes i suppose so</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: thats where all the action is right?</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: all the action that matters yeah</p>

          <p class="aradia">ARADIA: off we go then :)</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: word</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">He holds out his hand. She looks around, and assumes he means for her to take it, so she
          does. She didn’t know someone could fly this fast. He nearly yanks her arm out of its socket. She considers
          reminding him that maybe this isn’t necessary, since she can fly too. But she doesn’t want to risk saying more
          embarrassing stuff around this outrageously cool dude. Besides, they’re through the wormhole before she can
          even finish the thought. It vanishes the moment they’ve crossed.</p>
        <p>The hole leaves behind an absence in the sky so calm that continuing to call it a sky wouldn’t seem to do it
          justice. It’s a perfectly neutral expanse into which anything one can imagine might be summoned. And for a
          while, anything was. But not anymore. Where the hole gaped just moments ago, there now exists an imaginary
          line. </p>
        <p>Above this line resides all that matters. Below exists all else. Never again the twain shall meet.</p>
