        <p class="no-indent dirk"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm--md">S</span>o it turns out
          that “home” is an entirely abstract concept. A state of mind, if you will, rather than a literal, physical
          construct that can make you feel one way or the other. Terezi’s been gone long enough that her friends seem
          like strangers: entangled in relationship dynamics that she’s obliquely excluded from, embroiled in petty
          feuds, obsessed with politics. </p>
        <p class="dirk">Oh, do you want to know how those petty feuds and political obsessions turned out by the way? I
          thought it was pretty obvious, but I’ll say what’s up anyway.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Jane swept the election, of course. I told you I was going to win. After Jake’s incoherent and
          scandalous heel-turn at Karkat’s ill-fated rally, no amount of esoteric, three-dimensional jpeg artefacts
          could have salvaged the Vantas campaign. Besides, Dave and Karkat now have other concerns. Mainly that their
          BFF Jade has been in a coma for an entire month. They’ve been in and out of the hospital handling her affairs.
          Her next of kin is listed as John Egbert, and no one’s seen him in ages. It’s like he just disappeared
          suddenly. Like some great hand came out of the sky and crossed his name off the big list of guys we ever need
          to give a shit about anymore. </p>
        <p class="dirk">Terezi heard about Jade from a rather harried Kanaya, who is doubtlessly run ragged from the
          hot-potato plot circles that I’ve been sending her on for weeks to stop her from reading me the riot act for
          “kidnapping” her lovely wife. The woman is obviously hysterical and needs to chill the fuck out. I mean, she’s
          hysterical because I’ve been specifically and deliberately causing her to be that way, sure. But still. She
          should be fine soon enough.</p>
        <p class="dirk">It takes Terezi a couple days to work up the... </p>
        <p class="dirk">The <em>what</em>, exactly? What is she supposed to be feeling right now? I’m not sure myself.
          Maybe I should take a minute to think about the thing you’re supposed to feel when someone goes through
          whatever the hell it was she just went through. If I come up with any ideas, I could easily do her the favor
          of helping her feel it.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Whatever it is she’s supposed to feel, what she actually feels is empty. Colorless, dried up, as
          she walks beneath a holographic billboard displaying Jane’s glorious victory speech. The ceremony accompanying
          the speech is patently absurd, stuffed with so much pomp and circumstance that Terezi’s nose can’t make sense
          of what she’s supposed to be looking at. It’s all just light and color, signifying nothing. </p>
        <p class="dirk">Her internal smelloscope is so discombobulated from the onslaught of pastry-themed floats, and
          Jane’s tearful soliloquy on the Legacy of Responsibility she is about to inherit, that she mistakes the
          familiar figure standing in front of the hospital for someone else entirely.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy turns around and blinks in confusion. Terezi blinks back. Kanaya had warned her
          that Roxy had been going through some changes, but this still takes her by surprise.</p>
        <p class="dirk">So, in her defense, this was an honest mistake to make. Dave gets half of his genetics from
          Roxy, after all, and since her big heart-to-heart about the personal politics of queer onion metaphors, and
          ten stages of galaxy-braining through the many vicissitudes of the phrase “no homo,” Roxy has decided to
          really step up her gender experimentation. I guess at this point she’s gone beyond Stage Ten. Which I imagine
          is somewhat like reaching Super Saiyan 2 of gender, and then going even further beyond.</p>
        <p class="dirk">She’s got the Shades™ now, and sports one of those sweep-over hipster cuts Dave loves so much.
          Nothing ambiguous about this presentation, although if I’m being totally real, it’s a bit derivative. Anyway,
          I can’t complain too much about her decision to crib the Strider style, since, you know. She’s family.
          Besides, I’m T-minus ten hours from fucking off this gay Earth forever. It’s her life, her gender, her
          style—she can be whatever the fuck she wants.</p>
        <p class="dirk">Roxy’s whole face lights up when she sees Terezi.</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Terezi’s jaw tightens. She’s not ready to hear any words that remind her of those few
          hours with John. Her hand goes to her pocket, where she’s keeping the wallet. She traces the contours of it
          with her thumb and forces a smile.</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy seems almost effusive despite the circumstances. An earthy, genuine effusiveness
          that lights her up from inside. Terezi’s head is filled with stories about a different version of Roxy—the
          polar opposite of the one standing in front of her. </p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Pay respects? No, that’s dumb. Terezi knows that’s dumb. This is just a motion you go
          through. John would definitely want to be here, though, and technically Terezi is taking him with her. He may
          be in her pocket, but lately she’s been feeling more like he’s under her skin. She hasn’t told anyone what
          happened. But at least she knows she can look at him whenever she wants. </p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Terezi startles a bit when her phone buzzes. Who would even be messaging her now, when
          the only person she ever talked to is currently dead in her other pocket? She’s intrigued, but she thinks
          better of worrying about it. It’d be rude to look at her phone while she’s in the middle of a conversation.

        <p class="dirk">Roxy gives a shrug. A conflicted look crosses her face, but I can’t see past it. With the Dead
          Cherub out of the picture, the aura of void surrounding Roxy once again is impenetrable. Those baller shades
          aren’t exactly improving my odds of reading her, either. I’ll say again what I’ve always felt about her on

          weight of those words as uttered by this specific person. Because Terezi is a fixer, and it has been a very
          difficult lesson for her to learn that some things are simply out of her control. Maybe it’s just that Roxy

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Whatever was bothering Roxy, it passes quickly, and he says nothing about it. He puts
          his hand on Terezi’s shoulder and gives it a warm clap. The fraternal kind, which a couple of solid dudes
          might exchange after having just “bro’ed out.” It’s convincing, actually. Reasonably authentic, and quite
          masculine. He’s off to a great start exhibiting the mannerisms associated with his chosen gender. I’m
          genuinely proud of him.</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">As soon as Roxy’s gone, Terezi regrets lying to him about John. It’s a hard secret to
          keep, but probably a harder one to reveal. Maybe it would have been better if she <em>had</em> run into Dave
          instead of Roxy. It would have been easier to confide something like that to Dave, wouldn’t it? Well,
          <em>maybe</em> it would have been easier. Years ago, in a different timeline. And even then, she messed that
          up, didn’t she? But we can’t beat ourselves up too much for our teen mistakes. Let alone the stuff we can’t
          even remember, because it technically never even happened to us. We have enough to worry about as it is,
          right, Terezi?</p>

          a brilliant act that would fool everyone. You could potentially do that for the rest of your life. But it will
          eat into you, hollow you out like a parasite, because you’ll always refuse to allow yourself to be understood.

        <p class="dirk">And I do give her the time. I ease the throttle back a bit, just enough so that I’m not
          whispering directly into her ear when she slips the wallet out of her pocket. She clutches it so hard in her
          palm that she’s digging dents into the leather, and bites her lip. The gentle breeze is all she can hear. It’s
          louder than my voice, and in some understated way, makes my case for me more persuasively. She knows I’m
          right. </p>
