        <p>Two minutes before midnight, a teenage boy crosses beneath the neon lights of the Trollish slums, stepping
          quick and sure-footed atop the cracked pavement as if this is a path he’s walked many times. He’s got on a
          coat two sizes too big and a brimmed hat pulled down to hide his distinctive buck-toothed grin. Above him,
          Jane Crocker’s face beams out from a holographic propaganda display, reminding the populace that curfew is in
          fifteen minutes.</p>
        <p>This boy would like to say that he’s too cool and daring to care about curfew, but the sound of Jane’s
          cloying, prerecorded voice rising above the noisy streets sends an involuntary shiver down his spine. Luckily,
          the girl he’s come to meet does not suffer from the same instinctive Jane-based anxiety. She doesn’t have many
          fears or inhibitions at all. About a block from where they usually meet, she swings out of an alleyway and
          yanks him in by his elbow. He lets loose a shrill, unmasculine noise right into her mouth before she shuts him
          up with a kiss.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes of extremely novice make-out action, Harry Anderson and Vriska part, both wet-mouthed and
          short of breath. Harry Anderson wipes a bit of blood off of his bottom lip. Vriska pokes him in the chest and
          hisses.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

          of his parents’ genes, all things considered. He’s got his father’s infectious grin, his mother’s long

          a hundred rivers of gossamer lights in all the colors of the hemospectrum. Jane’s fleet is so massive that it
          blots out the lights of the capital. Is this what Alternia looked like from the sky as well? Aradia lived far

        <p class="no-indent">On Earth C, months go by at a breakneck pace. Teens fall in and out of love and hate.
          Alliances change, revolutions fully germinate, wars commence. And somewhere within that mess, John Egbert is
          the best man at Jade and Dave’s wedding. He lasts nearly two hours before he gets a ruinous case of the
          sniffles.</p>
        <p>The event is being held semi-clandestinely in the mansion of one of Jake’s wealthy television exec friends,
          staged as a “reunion party” for whichever one of his old, stupid television shows people get nostalgic about
          these days. It’s a smokescreen meant to throw the human government off the scent of political radicals like
          Rose and Kanaya partying just twenty miles from the seat of power. Jake claims there’s no way they’ll find
          them, but John sometimes gets the feeling that the whole planet’s bugged. After nearly ten years of unfettered
          monetary interference in the upper echelons of the global hegemony, could something like this possibly fly
          under Jane’s radar? It can’t, right? John likes to think she’s not so far gone that she’d tip off the
          government to send troops to arrest her friends and family on the occasion of her ecto-daughter’s wedding.
        </p>
        <p>So he smiles his way through his best man duties, then smiles his way again through the gallows-humor speech
          Rose gives at dinner, backlit by the flames of the Imperial Drone factories churning away on the horizon. He
          wears a possibly genuine expression for a few moments as he dips down to give Jade a kiss on the forehead. She
          looks beautiful in her dress, and Dave doesn’t look especially uncomfortable beside her. There is still joy to
          be found on the eve of a war, Rose says in her speech, but John found precious little to be happy about in
          this world even before everything went off the fucking chain. He is conspicuously unaccompanied. Not alone, of
          course: he’s been put in a honored seat at the head of the wedding party with Jade to his left and Rose to his
          right. But Jade is with Dave, and Rose has Kanaya and their daughter, and everyone knows that John has lost
          his family to Jane Crocker.</p>
        <p>Well, not literally to Jane Crocker. What drove Roxy away was him being depressed and just an all-around huge
          wet blanket who was impossible to live with. John is totally ready to own the fact that he was a bad husband,
          but maybe not the fact that he was a bad enough husband to drive his wife to passively support a brewing
          genocidal dictatorship. She looks happier, though, whenever he’s caught sight of her behind Jane—Calliope
          faithfully at her side—in any of the propaganda broadcasts that Jane passes off as business press conferences.
          By the time Roxy finally cut things off between them, he hadn’t personally seen her smile in years.</p>
        <p>John has no idea how Harry Anderson is doing, but he definitely caught Vriska texting him under the table
          when he got up to get another flute of champagne. She’s texting Tavros in another window, which is weird, but
          probably not as weird as John craning his neck to read messages over a teenage girl’s shoulder. The idea that
          Rose’s shitty daughter has more contact with his son than he does makes his eyes start to itch. He wanders out
          onto the ballroom balcony so that no one else has to see him cry for a second time tonight. It’s a balmy
          evening, and John can smell the oil burning at the forge across the harbor.</p>
        <p>There’s someone else occupying the balcony already, and it’s not one of the party guests. A shadow, standing
          with its back to the ocean, arms crossed, gaze fixed firmly on the ballroom windows. John takes a step closer
          and immediately recognizes Karkat’s nubby horns and distinctive shoulder-hunch. Of course.</p>
        <p>John snorts back his tears and jaunts forward with a jolly wave.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="john">JOHN: hi, karkat!</p>

          saw him in real life. In his Alternian military fatigues, and his admittedly bitchin’ eyepatch, he looks
          almost imposing. Kind of dashing, actually. When he opens his mouth, however, he’s just the same old Karkat.

          <p class="dave">DAVE: right?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">John swallows a lump down his throat. Terezi’s picture is still in his wallet: faded,
          dog-eared, marred by ragged white lines down the center from being folded and unfolded so many times, deep
          enough to be called valleys at this point.</p>

        <p class="no-indent">They fall silent for a moment, soaking up the atmosphere, sipping their booze,
          contemplating the suckiness of being an adult. Dave lets out a soft laugh and slaps John on the back. John
          swallows his champagne wrong and starts coughing.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVE: yo dude thanks for being my best man </p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: *cough* oh. th-thanks, man. no problem!</p>

        <p class="no-indent">They toast, lip of the glass to rim of the bottle. The sound rings out above the noise of
          the party inside. It rises up above the ocean, to where the stars are turning and dawn is already breaking on
          some other part of the planet. That’s how the years pass. Faster and faster the longer it goes. For those
          living on this iteration of Earth C, like John and Dave, it appears to be an illusion of age, an old adage
          about perception changing the older you get. The days get shorter the more the regrets pile up.</p>
        <p>But that’s only part of it. Above this Earth, the dead cherub is still meditating, waiting for the day when
          she can have her own heroic apotheosis. Waiting for the day when she can confront the one she calls the
          Prince. And on this Earth, John is just waiting for the day that feeling finally stops. That feeling that he’s
          still waiting for something, and the even worse feeling that years ago, he missed his only chance to put an
          end to it. If you stand on a very high hill at dawn, you can watch your shadow move in an arc around you. </p>
        <p>Ten years to the day he last spoke with Terezi, John finally gets rid of her photograph. He stands at the top
          of a very high hill, rips it into six pieces and lets the wind carry it away. Whatever else happens now... it
          doesn’t matter.</p>
