          of Heat and Clockwork in a flash of white. A column of brutally hot air blasts up from the lava below and
          instantly hits your entire body. Luckily, you’re fairly immortal, so the only damage it does is to fog up your
          glasses a bit. Through the condensation you can make out the shapes of Dave and Jade below, as well as two
          more of you hovering in the air above. Both Johns turn to look at you.</p>
        <p>On the ground, Dave is talking in a particular cadence, one that is familiar to you, his longtime best buddy.
          Casual, wandering, verging on droning. It’s a good indication he’ll be monologuing for a while, and probably
          already has been.</p>

            reality you use it all the time </p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: like doing lethal fuckin crane kicks and sweet karate chops while walking down the

          <p class="john">JOHN 3: not to sound like a wet blanket, but the things you’re trying to accomplish are now
            useless, so you can just zap away and do whatever you want.</p>
          <p class="john">(JOHN 1): ummm... </p>
          <p class="john">(JOHN 2): useless?? wait.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN 3: ok, maybe i shouldn’t have said that.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN 3: i’m sure you can still go and do what i did when i originally did what you’re
            currently trying to do... </p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: jesus john</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN 3: in fact, it will still probably be a very rewarding experience!</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN 3: some of my best memories happened right after you do what you’re about to do next.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN 3: the point is, you should just go do it, so that you aren’t here anymore.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN 3: i’m here to make sure some new and different important things happen, and those things
            don’t include you.</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: please dont tell me youve been spending the next however many years bungling through
            time like this because tbh if what i just witnessed was even remotely indicative of shit you get up to on a
            recurring basis then your future is almost too embarrassing to even think about</p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: and this is coming from a teenager who was just in the middle of an angsty episode</p>
          <p class="jade">JADE: <span class="jade-brainwashed">its true</span></p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: no, teen dave. this is not at all representative of my habits as an adult, but thanks
            for the concern.</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: no, you don’t need to capture me, and you wouldn’t be able to even if you wanted to,
            since my existence literally transcends the confines of canon.</p>
          <p class="jade">JADE: <span class="jade-brainwashed">well... </span></p>
          <p class="jade">JADE: <span class="jade-brainwashed">i guess that simplifies things then?</span></p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: sorry to be the bearer of lame news, like i just was to the other johns.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: but whatever you were doing doesn’t matter anymore.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: nothing that’s happening here matters at all.</p>

          <p class="john">JOHN: i pretty much had the same questions, dave.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: there are probably some pretty good answers to that. definitely some complicated

          <p class="john">JOHN: it has something to do with canon unraveling, and such.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: we all live outside canon in the future, and if we don’t do go do this, everything will
            stop meaning anything.</p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: does... </p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: anything you just said actually mean anything in the first place</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: that’s a great question, dave. </p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: one that i can’t say i’m qualified to answer!</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: i think the bottom line here is, this is what rose said we had to do.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: so, that’s why we’re doing it.</p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: sounds like a bullshit reason if i ever heard one</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: you might be right.</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: but is it less of a bullshit reason than any other reason we currently have to go fight
            him?</p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: ... </p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: damn</p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: youre right</p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: i dont know how you did it but you somehow instantly sold me completely</p>
          <p class="dave">DAVE: fuck you adult egbert</p>
          <p class="john">JOHN: heheh.</p>
