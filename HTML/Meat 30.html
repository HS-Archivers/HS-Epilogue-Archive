          tired from an afternoon of campaigning in the consort kingdom. jake is jaunting rigorously, as he put it, up
          the ridge of the mountain behind his mansion. every now and then, he pauses to accommodate the pace of his
          less limber friends.</p>

          who has been cheating on their hike by hovering very slightly off the ground rather than walking, catches
          karkat before his face hits the dirt. he sets his companion upright and continues to guide him with his hand
          on his back as he walks, the way an older human does with a small child who is learning to ride a bicycle.

            be the one ultimately in control of what information gets disseminated</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: our campaign slogan for the purpose of this conversation only is “hey isnt it cool how

            up make their “own decisions,” but trust me: Jake isn’t thinking for himself any more than he was while
            being indirectly controlled. Everything he’s thinking and feeling right now is merely reactive. He’s like a
            mostly dead bug twitching around on the last of its hemolymph after getting its head cut off. Under my
            guidance, he was like an ant being influenced by the cordyceps fungus. You can’t really call one of these
            “better” than the other, but at least the latter is being directed toward some greater purpose.</span></p>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">for a moment, jake thinks he hears something. a miniscule voice, prattling
          along vaingloriously. but he realizes it’s only a tiny insect buzzing about his ear. a gnat-like presence of
          absolutely no consequence. he simply waves it away.</p>

        <p class="calliope-dead">karkat unwinds from dave’s loose embrace, takes a deep breath, and clambers up the
          ridge to speak with jake in a more personable proximity. he has learned new methods for connecting with others
          on the campaign trail. how to speak broadly, with sweeping conviction, and yet create a sense of intimacy when
          addressing an individual. he has learned to come across as one who was once a leader, and could be again.</p>

            HER, BESIDES A SERIES OF PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES WHICH I KEEP BEING TOLD AREN’T TOO HARD ON THE EYES, BUT
            FRANKLY, I STILL DON’T KNOW IF I’M SEEING IT? </p>

        </div>
        <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jake chews on these remarks for a minute. he loves jane and dirk dearly. he
          has loved both of them for years, on and off, in multiple fashions and configurations, in accordance with the
          human understanding of this feeling. he thinks it could break jane’s heart were he to oppose her. and yet,
          hasn’t she fired the first shot by broadcasting such scandalous things about him in the media? and it was so
          soon after they’d nearly had an intimate reconciliation. the more he thinks on it, the more jake struggles to
          believe in the sincerity behind jane’s friendship with him.</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">and the prince?</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">dirk, as he knows him, hasn’t been given much thought by jake recently. jake has been
          savoring the fruits of a mental liberation he is barely aware of, let alone capable of comprehending. when he
          considers crossing dirk, he’s not afraid of making him angry or hurting his feelings. he’s simply always
          wanted to avoid disappointing him. and yet, with the cognitive cloud of dirk’s influence dispelled, jake now
          cannot shake the feeling that the best course of action would be the one that asserts the most independence
          from dirk, disappointment be damned.</p>
        <p class="calliope-dead">and to whatever extent the prince intends to put jake’s life in jeopardy, for now, his
          agency remains safely obscured from his sniper sight. </p>
