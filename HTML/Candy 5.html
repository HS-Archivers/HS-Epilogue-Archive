          <p class="jade">JADE: multiple days in a row even!</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO FUCKING WAY. THAT’S INCREDIBLE. I’VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING. </p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SOMEONE LEAVING THEIR HOUSE? STOP THE FUCKING PRESSES.</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: karkat....</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IS IT A SLOW NEWS DAY IN THE CONSORT KINGDOM OR SOMETHING?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade finishes pruning a dead bulb off her arum lily plant and flicks it at Karkat’s
          forehead. Then she politely pulls the blinds shut, because god forbid even a sliver of sunlight ever infect
          Dave and Karkat’s hive. Jade doesn’t live here, technically, but there’s domestic evidence of her all over the
          hive. Her plants, her bass, her clothes slung over the couch where she sleeps for weeks at a time...</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: im being serious dumpass</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: i was really worried about him!</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I’M BEING SERIOUS TOO. I WAS ACTUALLY BEGINNING TO WONDER IF JOHN HAD DIED. </p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BUT WHAT THE FUCK WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT? IT’S NOT LIKE HE ANSWERS THE
            PHONE.</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: well if you CARE so much then maybe dont respond with sarcasm when i tell you that hes
            getting better!</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: guys its not a competition we were all worried about john</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: were we??</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: whens the last time either of you tried to hang out with him?</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHEN’S THE LAST TIME EITHER OF US LEFT THE HIVE?</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah shut ins living in glass hives shouldnt throw uh</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: actually if we lived in a glass hive way too much light would come in for karkats brutal
            photosensitivity issues</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: so wed probably cover all the walls with like</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: lots of curtains and sheets of thick fabric</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: so i guess maybe we COULD throw stones?</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: like kinda small ones so that the fabric could easily absorb the momentum</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: also me and karkat would probably be too lazy to throw the stones that hard anyway</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: so i think actually this scenario is pretty workable here</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: it provides for a certain threshold of allowable minimum hypocrisy</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: dave this sucks</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: no it doesnt</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: im giving thoughtful and critical consideration to a cliche which is long past due</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: a glass house with wall to wall curtains creates what im going to theorize as an
            incredibly important “self owning buffer”</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: this is a huge breakthrough and also its fucking science</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: you of all people should appreciate the work being done here</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: oh my GOD</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: i never thought id be thinking of you as my weird nerd friend by the time we were in our
            twenties</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah well i never thought youd be like the premiere woo girl on the planet</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: what are you even doing here with us</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: dont you usually spend your weekends at 48 hour interspecies raves or doing arctic
            expeditions with jake or whatever</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: those two things are not always mutually exclusive hehe</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: UGH</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade floats over to the couch, shooting her two besties a salacious smile. She taps Karkat
          on the nose as she passes by.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: im just enjoying my youth</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: you could be enjoying it too hehehehe</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She retrieves one of her bras from where it’s hanging over the back of the couch. She
          starts changing it right there, doing that mystical sleight of hand girls seem to be born with the knowledge
          of, where the bra goes off and then on again without the shirt being removed. Jade doesn’t exactly have the
          best understanding of “interpersonal boundaries,” having been raised mostly by a dog, but still. It’s a weird,
          intimate, and uncomfortably close to sexual thing to be doing in front of other people. Dave and Karkat share
          a vaguely mortified look. Jade sort of lives here, but she doesn’t <em>that</em> sort of live here.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: but seriously.... what do you two even do holed up in here together all the time?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Karkat snorts, still pointedly not looking at her.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OH I’M SORRY, HAVE YOU NOT SEEN DAVE’S ILL BEGOTTEN ART EMPIRE?</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: HE’S GOT HIS OPPOSABLE DIGITS STUCK IN SO MANY DOUBLE-STACKED HUSKLOAFS THAT EVEN I
            DON’T KNOW ALL HIS PEN NAMES.</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: ok so thats what dave does</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: what do YOU do??</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade puts her feet on the floor and pads over so she can sling her arms over the back of
          the couch and lay her cheek on the cushion. The look she gives Karkat is just shy of devious. Karkat
          defensively scuttles to the other end of the couch, where he ends up pressed flush against Dave’s entire left
          side.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I UH</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: sit around and play video games all day?</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: HEY! THAT’S NOT THE ONLY THING I DO! I’VE...</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: DONE LAUNDRY.</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: once or twice</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: ALSO, WHAT HUMANS REFER TO AS “GROCERIES.”</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I DO THE GROCERIES.</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: thats not a fucking figure of speech man</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: you dont do the groceries you go out and buy them</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: and even then you dont actually do that</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: LIKE FUCK I MPHUMPHLE... </p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Dave puts both hands over Karkat’s mouth and does a stage whisper over his shoulder.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVE: he means that he uses the alchemizer in the basement sometimes</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: oh and when hes in a bad mood hell go yell at trolls on the internet</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: not like trolls as in the troll species i mean</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: literal trolls who talk shit online</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: i dunno a bunch of them could be actual trolls i guess</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: but not strictly</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: DAVE! </p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: DON’T FUCKING TELL HER ABOUT THAT.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Dave reaches around Karkat’s face to give him a gentle poke in the cheek. He keeps his
          finger there longer than strictly necessary, smiling the noticeably restrained smile characteristic of
          Striders. The expression is so warm and blatant that it can’t help but draw Jade’s attention. She frowns and
          pushes her glasses up the bridge of her nose, making some quick calculations in her head. They’re so obvious,
          she thinks, and yet here they are. Virginal losers who are performative about sitting exactly a foot apart
          whenever they’re in public. It’s so pathetic it makes her want to howl at the moon in sorrow. </p>
        <p>What she’s planning isn’t a seduction. It’s a public service.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVE: why not dude i think its cute</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: hes on all the major political sites of course but he spends most of his time going
            after people who leave abusive comments on my sweet bro and hella jeff posts</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: like hes got a whole complex network of burner accounts and sockpuppets on my homepage
            set up for every possible scenario</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: jesus christ....</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: its incredible hes driven at least ten people off the site by creating thinly veiled
            parody accounts of their usernames</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS!</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: MY EXPLOITS ARE HEROIC. GO ABSOLUTELY FUCK YOURSELF.</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: karkat shoosh</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: im so proud of you</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: couldnt have done better myself</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: well i mean i definitely could have but i have better things to do with my time</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THANK YOU DAVE. THAT WAS HEARTWARMING AND NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSING.
            CONSIDER MY HONOR UNDENIABLY DEFENDED.</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: actually karkat its more like youre the one defending HIS honor</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: thats sooooo cute.... a knight whiteknighting for another knight</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: dave its like karkats your adorable little house husband!!!</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: uhhhh</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT THE FUCK IS A HUSBAND?</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: er</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Dave un-pokes his finger from Karkat’s cheek and tries to shimmy some space between them on
          the couch, but there’s nowhere to go. Karkat is sandwiched between him and Jade, who is reaching out to put
          two fingers of her own at the center of his chest. She bounces them there a few times, enjoying the way troll
          skin is just a bit thicker than human skin, taut like the membrane over a poorly maintained drum.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: a husband.... </p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She begins walking her fingers up the length of Karkat’s sternum. Karkat knows damned well
          what a husband is. He’s been force-fed enough bad movies from Dave to pick up any human euphemism you could
          name. He still plays dumb sometimes, for comedic effect, to irritate his friends, or simply to avoid a topic
          of conversation altogether. If he’d known it would only fan the flames of discussion in this case, he would
          have kept his mouth shut.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: a husband is a little like what you both do already</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: only with....... certain “benefits” :)</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Her fingers reach the hollow of Karkat’s throat just in time to catch him swallow. He
          starts to sweat.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WH... WHAT KIND OF BENEFITS</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: heheh dont play dumb karkat</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: jade dude cmon</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: leave him alone</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade does not “come on.” She glides her fingers up under Karkat’s chin so that they can
          rest on his lips, which are a little chapped. It doesn’t take much work to pop them open and slide both
          fingers in.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: if youre really that clueless.... i can show you.... </p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Karkat looks like an animal with its leg caught in a trap. Eyes flickering, breath getting
          shallow. His bottom lip is trembling where Jade is stroking it with her thumb.</p>
        <p>It would be pretty easy to mistake his reaction for arousal, so it’s understandable that Jade is extremely
          surprised when Karkat snaps his jaw shut and chomps down on her hand.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: OW!!!!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">She flies back, literally, spiraling up towards the ceiling so fast that her skirt puffs up
          and she gets all tangled in her clothes for a few seconds. She clutches her wounded hand and glares daggers at
          Karkat, ears flat under her long, dark hair.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="jade">JADE: karkat what the HELL!</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT THE HELL??</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YOU’RE SERIOUSLY ASKING *ME* WHAT THE *HELL*!?!?!?</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JADE, YOU WERE TRYING TO CHOKE ME TO DEATH WITH YOUR WEIRD, SOFT HUMAN FINGERS! WHAT
            WERE YOU TRYING TO DO? REACH INTO MY CHEST AND PULL OUT MY FUCKING PUMP BISCUIT FOR A MIDDAY SNACK?</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IS THIS BECAUSE YOU’RE HALF BARKBEAST NOW?</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: NO!!!!!!</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: i was FLIRTING you dummy!</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: oh my GOD you two really are hopeless!</p>

          <p class="jade">JADE: why do i even WASTE my TIME???</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THAT’S A GOOD FUCKING QUESTION!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade is pissed, but not enough to leave. Instead, she plops down on the opposite end of the
          couch and petulantly crosses her arms. Karkat peels himself off Dave and slumps into the dip between cushions
          while settling even more deeply into one of his better-practiced pouts. Dave clears his throat.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVE: so apropos of nothing</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: just a cool segue into a completely different topic for no reason</p>
        </div>
        <p class="no-indent">Jade and Karkat both stare at him. He makes a casual motion with his hand. A smooth wrist
          swivel, like he’s at a turntable scratching one song into the next. That’s the effect he’s going for, at
          least.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="dave">DAVE: did you guys hear that jane was gonna run for high office</p>

          <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO FUCKING WAY</p>

          <p class="dave">DAVE: nah she was totally gonna pull the trigger on it after all these years but decided
