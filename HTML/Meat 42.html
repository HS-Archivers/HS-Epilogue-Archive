        </div>
        <p class="no-indent dirk">It’s fine, Kanaya. Why don’t we just say I’m invoking the mercy rule here. Jade is
          onto me obviously. But I wouldn’t have even let her wake up if there was anything you all could do about it by
          now. As the cherub resurfaces in her mind, I’ll be fading out of here soon anyway. I don’t see any reason to
          keep my dear friends in limbo any longer than they need to be.</p>
        <p class="dirk">So forget what I said. All that stuff about you not being good enough for her. It probably
          wasn’t true. I mean, what do I know? How worthy you are of another’s company is just a matter of the choices
          you make, right? I’m sure you could figure out how to prove your worth to her if you really tried. For now,
          the only thing that really matters is to acknowledge it’s too late for any of that.</p>
        <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
          <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Wait</p>

        <p class="no-indent dirk">Kanaya stares into the distance. The best fucking question anybody ever asked is: why
          am I so fucking awesome? I believe I’ve recently provided more than enough material to supply an answer to
          that question. But Kanaya may have just asked the second-best fucking question anybody ever asked. What WAS
          she thinking? What are any of us thinking, really? Who’s doing the thinking, and who’s having the thoughts?
        </p>
        <p class="dirk">The more you study the question, the more it seems all concrete forms of accountability go up in
          smoke. Her original thoughts were never that important, and the significance of the idea that she was the one
          authoring them was always a bit overrated. My mission is to someday clear this all up for everyone. Remove the
          ambiguity, suck the mud out of the water. It’ll be a lot better that way, trust me.</p>

          the sorrow anew from her wife’s departure, with a sense of rage and pain unshrouded by the veil of the prince.
          neither she nor her friends will have to worry about him anymore, so long as they remain on this planet and

          herself. theoretically, he could be stopped before he leaves, if they hurried. they would need to know what to
          do, where to go, and to have the motivation to do it, but time is short. i could push them to, with a certain
          degree of intervention, but i will not. my unwillingness to do so is what separates me from him. and what
          corporeal life needs now is someone presiding over them who is <em>nothing</em> like him at all.</p>
        <p class="no-indent dirk"><span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom--md">That’s a nice line. I get why you’d want to
            dial up the drama, making your grand reentrance and all. But the fact is, even if they wanted to, even if
            you brain-fried them all to become your own personal cherubic puppets and sent them on the warpath to come
            get me, they’d still never catch me. You still don’t get it yet.</span></p>
